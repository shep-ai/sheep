  ## Summary

  A single task covers the entire feature. There is no application code to
  write, no tests to add, and no infrastructure to change. The work is:
  create the file (ensuring zero bytes), verify the byte count, stage, and
  commit with the correct conventional commit message. TDD does not apply
  to a non-code file addition.
