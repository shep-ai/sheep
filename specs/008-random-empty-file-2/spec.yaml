oneLiner: Add a random empty file to the repository
userQuery: |
  Feature: Add random empty file! FAST!
summary: >
  This feature adds a new empty file to the repository at the root level,
  following the pattern established by prior content additions (JOKE.md,
  hello.py). The file must be empty (zero bytes), named consistently with
  repository conventions, and committed using the project's conventional commit
  style. No application logic or infrastructure changes are required.

openQuestions:
  - question: Where in the repository should the empty file be placed?
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: Repository root
        description: >
          Place the file at the root level alongside JOKE.md and hello.py. This
          is consistent with the existing pattern of trivially-added content
          files and is immediately visible to repository visitors. No
          subdirectory creation is needed.
        selected: true
      - option: Dedicated subdirectory
        description: >
          Place the file inside a new or existing subdirectory (e.g. assets/,
          misc/). This keeps the root cleaner for meaningful project files but
          adds a directory creation step and deviates from prior precedent.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      The repository root is recommended because the two prior trivial content
      files (JOKE.md, hello.py) live there, establishing a clear precedent.
      Consistency with that pattern is the fastest path and requires no
      additional structural decisions.
    answer: Repository root
  - question: What should the empty file be named?
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: EMPTY.md
        description: >
          A Markdown file named EMPTY.md. Mirrors the .md convention of JOKE.md,
          self-documents its emptiness, and is rendered by GitHub. Clear intent,
          zero ambiguity.
        selected: true
      - option: empty.txt
        description: >
          A plain-text file named empty.txt. Neutral extension, no Markdown
          rendering. Slightly less consistent with the .md files already at
          root.
        selected: false
      - option: random_file.py
        description: >
          A Python file to mirror hello.py. However, an empty .py file may
          confuse linters or import tooling even if it has no content, adding
          unnecessary risk.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      EMPTY.md is recommended because it mirrors the .md convention of the
      closest prior art (JOKE.md), is self-descriptive, will not trigger any
      linter or Python tooling, and is rendered natively on GitHub with no
      special viewer required.
    answer: EMPTY.md
  - question: What git commit message format should be used?
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'feat: add empty file'
        description: >
          Minimal conventional-commit message matching the project's existing
          style (e.g. "feat: Add hello.py file", "feat(content): add JOKE.md").
          Short, accurate, no noise.
        selected: true
      - option: 'chore: add empty file'
        description: >
          Uses the 'chore' type, which some projects prefer for non-functional
          changes. However, prior trivial additions in this repo used 'feat', so
          'chore' would be inconsistent.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      The project's commit history uses 'feat' for all content additions
      (hello.py, JOKE.md). Using 'feat' maintains consistency with that pattern.
      The message body is intentionally minimal to match the scope of the
      change.

  ## Problem Statement


  The user wants to add a random empty file to the repository as quickly as

  possible. This follows an established pattern in the project's commit history,

  where small content files (JOKE.md, hello.py) have been added in prior feature

  branches. The feature has no functional impact on the application — it is

  purely a repository addition.


  ## Success Criteria


  - [ ] A single new file exists at the repository root after the change

  - [ ] The file contains exactly zero bytes (is truly empty)

  - [ ] The filename follows repository naming conventions and matches the
  AI-recommended name (EMPTY.md)

  - [ ] The file is tracked by Git (appears in `git ls-files`)

  - [ ] The commit message follows the project's conventional commit format
  (`feat: ...`)

  - [ ] The CI/CD pipeline passes without modification (lint, test, build all
  green)

  - [ ] No existing files are modified


  ## Functional Requirements


  - **FR-1**: A new file SHALL be created at the repository root level.

  - **FR-2**: The file SHALL have zero bytes of content (truly empty — no
  whitespace, newlines, or BOM).

  - **FR-3**: The file SHALL be named `EMPTY.md` (or the name selected via the
  open question above).

  - **FR-4**: The file SHALL be staged and committed to the feature branch using
  a conventional commit message of the form `feat: add <filename>`.

  - **FR-5**: No existing files in the repository SHALL be modified as part of
  this change.


  ## Non-Functional Requirements


  - **NFR-1**: The change SHALL not cause any CI/CD pipeline stage (lint, test,
  build, docker) to fail.

  - **NFR-2**: The file extension SHALL be chosen such that it does not trigger
  Python linters (flake8, ruff) or import resolution — a `.md` or `.txt`
  extension satisfies this; a `.py` extension is disallowed unless confirmed
  safe.

  - **NFR-3**: The commit SHALL follow the project's conventional commit style,
  keeping the subject line under 72 characters.

  - **NFR-4**: The overall change (file creation + commit) SHALL be completable
  in under 5 minutes of wall-clock time.


  ## Product Questions & AI Recommendations


  | # | Question | AI Recommendation | Rationale |

  | - | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |

  | 1 | Where should the file be placed? | Repository root | Consistent with
  JOKE.md and hello.py precedent; no subdirectory needed |

  | 2 | What should the file be named? | EMPTY.md | Mirrors .md convention,
  self-descriptive, safe for all tooling |

  | 3 | What commit message format? | `feat: add EMPTY.md` | Matches existing
  'feat' prefix used for all prior content additions |


  ## Affected Areas


  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |

  | ---- | ------ | --------- |

  | Repository root | Low | A single new empty file is added; no application
  logic is touched |

  | CI/CD pipeline | None | Pipeline runs lint/test/build; an empty non-Python
  file triggers no failures |

  | `src/sheep/` package | None | No source code changes required |

  | `tests/` | None | No new tests needed for an empty file |


  ## Dependencies


  - None. This feature depends only on the Git repository itself.

  - No libraries, infrastructure, or existing application code needs to be
    modified or extended.

  ## Size Estimate


  **S** — This is a sub-5-minute task. It requires creating a single empty file,

  staging it with `git add`, and committing with an appropriate message.

  No code review, testing, or architectural decisions are required beyond

  the product questions resolved above.
