name: random-empty-file-2
summary: >
  Adding EMPTY.md to the repository root requires no libraries, no code changes,
  and no infrastructure modifications. The sole technical decisions are file
  naming/extension and commit message format, both fully resolved by precedent
  in the existing commit history (JOKE.md, hello.py, feat: prefixes).

decisions:
  - title: 'File Naming and Extension'
    chosen: 'EMPTY.md — a Markdown file at the repository root'
    rejected:
      - 'empty.txt — neutral extension but inconsistent with the .md convention
        established by JOKE.md, the closest prior art for a trivially-added
        content file'
      - 'random_file.py — mirrors hello.py extension but an empty .py file may
        confuse Python linters (flake8, ruff) and import resolution tooling even
        with zero content, adding unnecessary CI risk'
    rationale: >
      The repository root contains JOKE.md and hello.py as prior trivially-added
      content files. JOKE.md sets the strongest precedent for a non-code content
      addition: it uses the .md extension, lives at root, and has no application
      logic. EMPTY.md mirrors that pattern exactly. The .md extension is ignored
      by Python tooling (flake8, ruff, mypy), will not cause import errors, and
      is rendered natively on GitHub. The name "EMPTY.md" is self-descriptive,
      unambiguous, and requires no additional explanation in commit messages or
      documentation.

  - title: 'File Content (Zero Bytes vs. Placeholder Text)'
    chosen: 'Truly empty file — exactly zero bytes, no whitespace, no newline, no BOM'
    rejected:
      - 'Single newline character — some editors and POSIX tools add a trailing
        newline automatically; this would make the file non-empty and violate
        FR-2 of the spec'
      - 'Placeholder comment (e.g. <!-- empty -->) — adding any content defeats
        the stated purpose of the feature and adds unnecessary bytes'
    rationale: >
      The spec explicitly requires zero bytes (FR-2). Creating the file via
      touch or writing an empty string guarantees this. Git tracks empty files
      correctly; there are no Git-level restrictions on zero-byte blobs. No CI
      tooling in this project (flake8, ruff, pytest, Docker) inspects .md file
      content, so a zero-byte .md file is safe throughout the pipeline.

  - title: 'Commit Message Format'
    chosen: "'feat: add EMPTY.md'"
    rejected:
      - "'chore: add EMPTY.md' — the project commit history exclusively uses
        feat for all content additions (hello.py at 0c5670c, JOKE.md at
        f590938, joke-markdown-2 at b64cf80); chore would be inconsistent"
      - "'feat(content): add EMPTY.md' — the scoped form was used once
        (f590938) but the simpler unscoped form is more common and is the
        minimal conventional commit style"
    rationale: >
      Scanning the git log shows 'feat:' (unscoped) is the dominant prefix for
      all trivial content additions. The one scoped example 'feat(content):' was
      used for a PR merge commit. Consistency with the majority pattern and
      keeping the subject line minimal (well under 72 characters) favors the
      unscoped form. The message "feat: add EMPTY.md" is accurate, concise, and
      matches the style of "feat: Add hello.py file".

  ## Technology Decisions

  ### 1. File Naming and Extension

  **Chosen:** `EMPTY.md` at the repository root

  **Rejected:**
  - `empty.txt` — neutral but inconsistent with the `.md` convention of JOKE.md
  - `random_file.py` — empty `.py` files risk linter/import tooling noise in CI

  **Rationale:** JOKE.md is the closest precedent for a non-code content file
  added to the root. EMPTY.md mirrors its extension, is self-descriptive, and is
  invisible to Python tooling.

  ### 2. File Content

  **Chosen:** Exactly zero bytes (truly empty)

  **Rejected:**
  - Trailing newline — violates FR-2 (zero bytes required)
  - Placeholder comment — defeats the feature purpose

  **Rationale:** `touch EMPTY.md` or writing an empty string produces a
  zero-byte file. Git handles empty blobs correctly. No CI stage inspects `.md`
  content.

  ### 3. Commit Message

  **Chosen:** `feat: add EMPTY.md`

  **Rejected:**
  - `chore: add EMPTY.md` — 'chore' is not used for content additions in this repo
  - `feat(content): add EMPTY.md` — scoped form is less common than unscoped

  **Rationale:** The unscoped `feat:` prefix is used for all comparable prior
  additions in the commit history.

  ## Library Analysis

  | Library | Purpose | Decision | Reasoning |
  | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
  | None    | N/A     | N/A      | No libraries needed; pure Git file addition |

  ## Security Considerations

  No security implications. The file is empty and adds no executable code,
  secrets, or configuration. The `.md` extension prevents accidental execution.
  There is no attack surface introduced by a zero-byte Markdown file.

  ## Performance Implications

  No performance implications. A zero-byte file has negligible impact on
  repository clone time and no impact on application runtime, CI execution time,
  or Docker image size (the Dockerfile targets src/ and pyproject.toml, not root
  content files).

  ## Architecture Notes

  This change is entirely outside the application architecture. Repository
  structure after the change:

  ```

  ├── hello.py
  ├── pyproject.toml
  ├── Dockerfile

  No imports, modules, tests, or CI changes required.
