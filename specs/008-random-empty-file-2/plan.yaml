# Implementation Plan (YAML)
# This is the source of truth. Markdown is auto-generated from this file.

name: random-empty-file-2
summary: >
  Add a single zero-byte file (EMPTY.md) to the repository root, following the
  precedent set by JOKE.md and hello.py. No application logic, tests, or
  infrastructure changes are required. The entire change is a file creation and
  a conventional commit.

      Create EMPTY.md at the repository root with exactly zero bytes, stage it,
      and commit with a conventional commit message. This is the only phase
      needed — there are no dependencies, no code changes, and no CI

  ## Architecture Overview

  This feature exists entirely outside the application architecture. The
  repository root already hosts two precedent content files (JOKE.md, hello.py)
  added in prior feature branches. EMPTY.md is a third such file — zero bytes,
  tracked by Git, invisible to Python tooling and CI pipelines.

  No src/, tests/, or configuration files are touched.

  ## Key Design Decisions

  **File name and extension — EMPTY.md**
  JOKE.md is the closest prior art: a non-code content file at root with a .md
  extension. EMPTY.md mirrors that pattern exactly. The .md extension is ignored
  by flake8, ruff, mypy, and pytest, ensuring CI remains green. The name is
  self-descriptive and requires no additional documentation.

  **File content — exactly zero bytes**
  FR-2 requires zero bytes. No trailing newline, no BOM, no placeholder text.
  Git handles zero-byte blobs correctly. The file is created via `touch` or
  equivalent to guarantee this.

  **Commit message — `feat: add EMPTY.md`**
  The project commit history uses the unscoped `feat:` prefix for all trivial
  content additions (feat: Add hello.py file, feat(content): add JOKE.md).
  The unscoped form is the majority pattern. The message is accurate, minimal,
  and under 72 characters.

  ## Implementation Strategy

  Single phase. Create the file, verify it is zero bytes, stage it, and commit.
  No ordering complexity exists — this is a linear, sub-5-minute operation.

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | File accidentally non-empty (editor adds newline) | Use `touch EMPTY.md` rather than an editor; verify with `wc -c EMPTY.md` (must output 0) |
  | Wrong commit message format | Use the exact string `feat: add EMPTY.md`; check against project history |
  | CI failure from .md linting | No .md linter is configured in this project; confirmed safe by research |
