# Implementation Plan (YAML)

name: state-machine-diagram-92e7c4
summary: >
  Create a single new file STATE_MACHINE.md at the repository root containing a level-1
  heading, one-line description, and a valid stateDiagram-v2 Mermaid fenced code block
  depicting a traffic light state machine. Purely additive — no existing files are touched.

  ## Architecture Overview

  This feature is entirely additive: one new file at the repository root, zero modifications
  to existing files. The repo already contains standalone all-caps Markdown content files
  (JOKE.md, JOKE2.md, DESIGN_PATTERN.md, SHEEP.md) — STATE_MACHINE.md slots in as another
  member of that collection with no integration or coupling to the Python source tree, tests,
  Docker config, or CI pipeline.

  GitHub natively renders Mermaid `stateDiagram-v2` fenced code blocks, so no build step,
  CLI tool, or plugin is required to view the diagram.

  ## Key Design Decisions

  ### 1. Mermaid dialect: stateDiagram-v2

  `stateDiagram-v2` is the current canonical syntax and is explicitly required by FR-2.
  The `[*]` initial pseudo-state, labelled transitions via `:`, and rectangular state boxes
  produce a self-documenting diagram with minimal markup. v1 and `flowchart LR` were rejected
  (see research decisions).

  ### 2. File structure: heading + one sentence + diagram block

  Matches the concise style of every other content file in the repo. A single descriptive
  sentence provides just enough context while keeping total line count well under 30 (FR-7).
  A full paragraph would contradict the user's "short" and "fast" intent.

  ### 3. Filename: STATE_MACHINE.md

  Follows the ALL_CAPS underscore convention established by all existing standalone content
  files (JOKE.md, JOKE2.md, DESIGN_PATTERN.md, SHEEP.md). Consistency is the sole driver.

  ## Implementation Strategy

  Single phase, single task. The entire implementation is writing ~20 lines of Markdown.
  There are no dependencies, no setup steps, and no teardown. The file is authored directly
  using the exact Mermaid stateDiagram-v2 syntax that GitHub renders natively.

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | Invalid Mermaid syntax breaks GitHub rendering | Validate diagram structure against stateDiagram-v2 spec; use only well-known syntax |
  | File exceeds 30-line limit (FR-7) | Keep diagram to 3 states and 4 transitions; count lines before finalising |
  | Wrong filename casing | Use exact string STATE_MACHINE.md; verify after creation |
