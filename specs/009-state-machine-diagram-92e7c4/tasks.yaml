  ## Summary

  A single task creates the entire feature. There is no code to test, no integration to wire,
  and no configuration to change — the work is authoring a ~20-line Markdown file. The task
  is complete when STATE_MACHINE.md exists at the repo root and passes all acceptance criteria
  in the structured task definition above.
