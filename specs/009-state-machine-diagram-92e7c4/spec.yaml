oneLiner: Create a short markdown file containing a Mermaid state machine diagram
userQuery: >
  create simple short md file with diagram of random state machine, fast, no research, no thinking!
summary: >
  Add a new markdown file to the repository root containing a simple Mermaid stateDiagram-v2
  diagram depicting a random state machine (e.g. a traffic light or vending machine).
  This is a pure content-creation task with no code changes required.

  ## Problem Statement

  The repository already contains several standalone markdown content files (JOKE.md,
  JOKE2.md, DESIGN_PATTERN.md, SHEEP.md). This feature adds another such file — a short
  markdown document with a Mermaid state machine diagram — following the same convention.

  ## Codebase Analysis

  ### Project Structure

  The repo root contains standalone content `.md` files alongside the Python source tree:

  ```
  /
  ├── JOKE.md            # Short joke content
  ├── JOKE2.md           # Another joke
  ├── DESIGN_PATTERN.md  # Observer pattern explanation
  ├── SHEEP.md           # Sheep story
  ├── specs/             # Feature specs (YAML + generated Markdown)
  ├── src/sheep/         # Python agentic platform source
  └── tests/             # Python tests
  ```

  ### Architecture Patterns

  - Standalone markdown files live at the repository root with an all-caps or
    title-case filename (e.g. `STATE_MACHINE.md`).
  - No build step or toolchain processes these files; they are static content.
  - Diagrams can use fenced Mermaid code blocks (``` ```mermaid ``` ), which GitHub
    and most modern markdown renderers render natively.

  ### Relevant Technologies

  - **Markdown** — file format for all content files in the repo.
  - **Mermaid stateDiagram-v2** — lightweight DSL for state machine diagrams, renders
    in GitHub, VS Code, and other common viewers without any extra tooling.

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | Repository root (new file) | Low | A single new `.md` file is added; no existing files are modified |

  ## Dependencies

  None. No code, libraries, or infrastructure changes required. The file is pure Markdown.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Single new markdown file with a short Mermaid diagram (~20 lines). No code
  changes, no tests, no configuration. Minimal effort.
