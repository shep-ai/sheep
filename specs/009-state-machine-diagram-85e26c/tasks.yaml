  ## Summary

  A single task in a single phase. The entire implementation is one Write operation:
  create STATE_MACHINE.md at the repository root with a level-1 heading and a
  stateDiagram-v2 Mermaid block illustrating the sheep lifecycle. No code changes,
  no tests, no dependencies to install or configure. TDD does not apply to a pure
  static content file.
