oneLiner: Create a short markdown file containing a simple state machine diagram
userQuery: >
  create simple short md file with diagram of random state machine, fast, no research, no thinking!
summary: >
  Create a single markdown file in the repo root containing a simple state machine diagram
  using Mermaid syntax. This is a trivial content-only task requiring no code changes —
  just a new markdown file with a stateDiagram block illustrating a random state machine.

  ## Problem Statement

  The repository currently has content files (JOKE.md, JOKE2.md, SHEEP.md) but no visual
  diagram artifacts. The request is to add a simple markdown file containing a state machine
  diagram using Mermaid syntax — a fast, no-frills content task.

  ## Codebase Analysis

  ### Project Structure

  The repo root contains several standalone markdown content files:
  - `JOKE.md`, `JOKE2.md` — joke content files
  - `SHEEP.md` — a sheep story
  - `DESIGN_PATTERN.md` — design pattern analysis
  - `README.md` — main project documentation

  The `specs/` directory holds per-feature YAML specs and generated artifacts.
  The `src/` directory contains the Python sheep platform source code.

  ### Architecture Patterns

  Content files live directly at the repo root as standalone `.md` files with uppercase
  names (matching `README.md`, `JOKE.md`, `SHEEP.md` convention). No build pipeline
  processes these files — they are pure documentation/content artifacts.

  ### Relevant Technologies

  - **Markdown**: All content files use GitHub-flavored Markdown.
  - **Mermaid**: GitHub renders Mermaid diagrams natively in markdown using fenced code
    blocks with the `mermaid` language tag. The `stateDiagram-v2` directive is the
    appropriate choice for state machine diagrams.

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | Repo root (new file) | Low | A new `STATE_MACHINE.md` file is added; no existing files are modified |

  ## Dependencies

  None. This is a pure content task — no source code, no libraries, no configuration.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Single new markdown file with ~20 lines of content. No code changes, no tests,
  no configuration. Estimated effort: minutes.
