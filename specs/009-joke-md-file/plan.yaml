  Pure content addition: create JOKE3.md at the repository root following the
  exact structure of JOKE2.md (H1 heading, bold Q&A, trailing horizontal rule).

      Create JOKE3.md at the repository root with a single programming-themed
      Q&A joke matching the established structure. This is the only phase — the
      task is purely additive with no setup, no dependencies, and no follow-up.

  ## Architecture Overview

  The repository uses a flat structure with joke markdown files placed directly
  at the root alongside README and other standard files. The pattern established
  by JOKE.md and JOKE2.md is:

  ```
  # Joke

  **Q:** <setup>

  **A:** <punchline>

  ---
  ```

  JOKE3.md replicates this structure exactly. No directory reorganization,
  no index files, no cross-references — just a new file following the
  existing naming convention (`JOKE{N}.md`, uppercase, root level).

  ## Key Design Decisions

  ### File Structure: Mirror JOKE2.md exactly
  JOKE2.md is the most recent and minimal prior art: H1 heading, bold **Q:**/**A:**
  labels, single joke, trailing `---`. JOKE3.md uses the same structure for
  identical GitHub rendering and consistency.

  JOKE.md includes multiple jokes and non-Q&A content; JOKE2.md is the canonical
  minimal template. Using JOKE2.md as the reference keeps scope minimal.

  ### Joke Content: Single programming-themed Q&A
  Both open questions were resolved in the spec: Q&A format, programming theme.
  A single joke (like JOKE2.md) stays well under the 20-line NFR and fulfills
  the user's "short and stupid" intent. Multi-joke collections and general humor
  were explicitly rejected.

  ### No Tooling Required
  This is a pure static content file. No linters, validators, or build steps
  are needed. GitHub renders GFM markdown safely with HTML sanitization.

  ## Implementation Strategy

  Single phase, single task: create the file. The ordering is trivially determined
  by the fact that there is only one deliverable with no dependencies.

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | File already exists (JOKE3.md) | Verify with ls before creating; spec confirms it does not exist |
  | Wrong file name casing | Use uppercase JOKE3.md per NFR-3; confirmed by JOKE.md and JOKE2.md |
  | Structural drift from prior files | Use JOKE2.md as direct template reference during authoring |
  | Exceeding 20-line NFR | Single Q&A joke is ≤ 8 lines; no risk |
