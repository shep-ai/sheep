summary: >
  This is a pure content task requiring no libraries, build tooling, or code changes.
  The existing JOKE.md and JOKE2.md files establish a clear pattern: H1 heading "# Joke",
  bold Q&A format, and a trailing horizontal rule separator. JOKE3.md must replicate
  that structure with a new programming-themed Q&A joke.

decisions:
  - title: 'File Naming Convention'
    chosen: 'JOKE3.md — uppercase filename at repository root'
    rejected:
      - 'joke3.md (lowercase) — inconsistent with JOKE.md and JOKE2.md; violates NFR-3'
      - 'jokes/JOKE3.md (subdirectory) — no jokes/ directory exists; would break the flat pattern'
    rationale: >
      Both prior files (JOKE.md, JOKE2.md) use uppercase filenames placed directly
      at the repository root. The spec explicitly states the JOKEН.md uppercase
      naming convention as a non-functional requirement. No alternative placement
      exists in the codebase.

  - title: 'Markdown Structure and Formatting'
    chosen: '# Joke heading, bold **Q:**/**A:** Q&A block, trailing --- horizontal rule'
    rejected:
      - 'Plain text Q/A without bold markers — loses visual hierarchy; inconsistent with JOKE2.md'
      - 'Different heading (## or no heading) — JOKE.md and JOKE2.md both use H1 # Joke'
    rationale: >
      JOKE2.md is the closest prior art: H1 heading, bold **Q:** and **A:** labels,
      single joke, trailing ---. JOKE3.md should mirror this exactly for consistency.
      JOKE.md also confirms bold Q&A as the primary joke format. Using the same
      structure ensures the file renders identically on GitHub.

  - title: 'Joke Content Selection'
    chosen: 'Single programming-themed Q&A joke referencing a programming language or concept'
    rejected:
      - 'General humor joke — breaks the developer-culture theme established by both prior files'
      - 'Multi-joke collection — exceeds minimal scope; spec requires ≤ 20 lines and "short and stupid"'
    rationale: >
      The spec resolves both open questions in favor of Q&A format and programming theme.
      A single joke keeps the file under 10 lines, well within the 20-line NFR.
      The prior files (dark mode / bug joke in JOKE.md, Java/C# joke in JOKE2.md)
      demonstrate the tone: short, groan-worthy, developer-culture puns.

  ## Technology Decisions

  ### 1. File Naming Convention

  **Chosen:** `JOKE3.md` — uppercase filename at repository root

  **Rejected:**
  - `joke3.md` (lowercase) — inconsistent with `JOKE.md` and `JOKE2.md`; violates NFR-3
  - `jokes/JOKE3.md` (subdirectory) — no `jokes/` directory exists; breaks the established flat layout

  **Rationale:** Both prior files use uppercase filenames at the repo root. NFR-3 explicitly
  requires the `JOKEН.md` uppercase convention.

  ### 2. Markdown Structure and Formatting

  **Chosen:** `# Joke` heading + bold `**Q:**`/`**A:**` + trailing `---`

  **Rejected:**
  - Plain text Q/A without bold — loses visual hierarchy; inconsistent with JOKE2.md
  - Alternative heading levels — JOKE.md and JOKE2.md both use H1 `# Joke`

  **Rationale:** JOKE2.md is the canonical reference: H1 heading, bold Q&A, single joke, trailing `---`.
  Replicating this structure ensures identical GitHub rendering.

  ---

  ### 3. Joke Content Selection

  **Chosen:** Single programming-themed Q&A joke

  **Rejected:**
  - General humor — breaks developer-culture theme of the collection
  - Multi-joke collection — out of scope; spec requires ≤ 20 lines

  **Rationale:** Spec explicitly resolves both open questions: Q&A format, programming theme.
  A single joke stays well under the 20-line NFR and matches user intent ("short and stupid").

  ## Library Analysis

  | Library | Purpose | Decision | Reasoning |
  | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
  | None    | N/A     | N/A      | Pure markdown content file; no tooling required |

  ## Security Considerations

  No security implications. This is a static markdown file with no executable code,
  no user input, no external links, and no access to sensitive data. GitHub renders
  markdown safely with HTML sanitization by default.

  ## Performance Implications

  No performance implications. A small markdown file (< 20 lines) has negligible
  impact on repository size, clone time, or CI duration.

  ## Architecture Notes

  The repository has a flat structure with joke files at the root alongside standard
  files (README, etc.). No directory reorganization is needed or appropriate.
  JOKE3.md is a pure content addition with zero impact on any other file, build
  system, or workflow. The existing pattern (JOKE.md → JOKE2.md → JOKE3.md) is
  a simple incrementing numeric suffix — no naming conflict is possible.
