oneLiner: Add a new markdown file containing a short, stupid joke
userQuery: >
  create simple short md file with stupid joke, fast, no research, no thinking!
summary: >
  Add a new markdown joke file (e.g. JOKE3.md) following the established pattern
  of JOKE.md and JOKE2.md. The file should contain a short, simple programming
  or general humor joke in markdown format. This is a trivial content-only task.

  ## Problem Statement

  The repository collects joke markdown files as lightweight content artifacts.
  JOKE.md and JOKE2.md already exist. This feature adds another joke file to
  continue the pattern, with no infrastructure or code changes required.

  ## Codebase Analysis

  ### Project Structure

  - `JOKE.md` — first joke file with Q&A format and standalone jokes
  - `JOKE2.md` — second joke file with a Java/C# Q&A joke
  - `JOKE3.md` (to be created) — new joke file following the same pattern
  - `specs/` — feature spec YAMLs, one directory per feature
  - `src/` — Python source code (not affected)
  - `tests/` — test suite (not affected)

  ### Architecture Patterns

  The joke files are standalone markdown content files at the repository root.
  No application code or build system is involved. The convention is a short
  Q&A joke or pun, optionally with a horizontal rule separator.

  ### Relevant Technologies

  - Markdown: the sole format used for joke files

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | JOKE3.md (new file) | Low | New content file, no code changes |

  ## Dependencies

  None. This is a pure content addition with no code dependencies.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Creating a single markdown file with one joke. Estimated effort: minutes.
