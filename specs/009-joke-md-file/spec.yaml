oneLiner: Add a new markdown file containing a short, stupid joke
userQuery: >
  create simple short md file with stupid joke, fast, no research, no thinking!
summary: >
  Add JOKE3.md at the repository root following the established pattern of JOKE.md
  and JOKE2.md. The file must contain a short, self-contained programming or
  general-humor joke in markdown format, using Q&A or pun style with a horizontal
  rule separator. This is a trivial content-only task with no code changes.

# Open questions (must be resolved before implementation)
openQuestions:
  - question: 'What joke style should JOKE3.md use?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Q&A joke'
        description: >
          A question-and-answer format punchline (e.g. "Why did the programmer...?
          Because..."). Consistent with JOKE.md and JOKE2.md, easy to write and
          immediately readable.
        selected: true
      - option: 'Standalone pun or one-liner'
        description: >
          A single-sentence pun or observational joke with no setup/punchline
          split. Slightly less structured but equally valid for short humor.
        selected: false
      - option: 'Multi-joke collection'
        description: >
          Several jokes in one file (like JOKE.md which has multiple entries).
          Adds more content but goes beyond the minimal scope requested.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      Q&A format is recommended because it directly mirrors the style used in
      JOKE2.md and the primary jokes in JOKE.md, keeps the file minimal, and
      matches the user's "short, stupid joke" intent with a clean setup/punchline
      structure that is instantly legible in markdown.
    answer: 'Q&A joke'

  - question: 'Should the joke be programming-themed or general humor?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Programming-themed'
        description: >
          Joke references a programming language, concept, or developer culture.
          Consistent with JOKE.md (Python/logic jokes) and JOKE2.md (Java/C#),
          fits the repo's developer audience.
        selected: true
      - option: 'General humor'
        description: >
          A generic, non-technical joke. Broader appeal but breaks the
          programming-joke theme established by prior files.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      Programming-themed jokes are recommended because both existing joke files
      (JOKE.md, JOKE2.md) use developer-culture humor. Maintaining this theme
      creates a coherent collection and aligns with the repository's technical
      audience.
    answer: 'Programming-themed'

# Markdown content (the actual spec)

  ## Problem Statement

  The repository collects joke markdown files as lightweight content artifacts.
  JOKE.md and JOKE2.md already exist. This feature adds JOKE3.md to continue the
  pattern, with no infrastructure or code changes required.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] `JOKE3.md` exists at the repository root
  - [ ] The file is valid markdown (renders without errors)
  - [ ] The file contains exactly one joke in Q&A format
  - [ ] The joke is programming-themed
  - [ ] The file uses a horizontal rule (`---`) as a separator, matching JOKE2.md style
  - [ ] The file is ≤ 20 lines (keeping it short and stupid, per user intent)
  - [ ] No existing files are modified

  ## Functional Requirements

  - **FR-1**: A new file named `JOKE3.md` MUST be created at the repository root.
  - **FR-2**: The file MUST contain at least one joke with a clear setup and punchline.
  - **FR-3**: The joke MUST be formatted as a Q&A (question on one line, answer on the next or separated by a blank line).
  - **FR-4**: The file MUST include a horizontal rule (`---`) as a visual separator, consistent with JOKE2.md.
  - **FR-5**: The joke content MUST be programming-themed (language, concept, or developer culture reference).

  ## Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR-1**: The file MUST be valid GitHub-Flavored Markdown — no raw HTML, no broken syntax.
  - **NFR-2**: The file MUST be ≤ 20 lines to stay "short and stupid" per the user's explicit request.
  - **NFR-3**: The filename MUST follow the existing `JOKEН.md` uppercase naming convention.
  - **NFR-4**: No source code, tests, or other repository files may be modified as a side effect.

  ## Product Questions & AI Recommendations

  | # | Question | AI Recommendation | Rationale |
  | - | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
  | 1 | What joke style should JOKE3.md use? | Q&A joke | Mirrors JOKE.md and JOKE2.md; clean setup/punchline in markdown |
  | 2 | Should the joke be programming-themed or general humor? | Programming-themed | Both prior files use dev-culture humor; maintains coherent collection |

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | JOKE3.md (new file) | Low | New content file, no code changes |

  ## Dependencies

  None. This is a pure content addition with no code dependencies.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Creating a single markdown file with one joke. Estimated effort: minutes.
  Requirements analysis confirms no scope creep; size estimate unchanged.
