openQuestions:
  - question: 'What filename should the joke markdown file use?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'JOKE.md'
        description: 'Simple, uppercase convention matching README.md. Immediately recognizable at repo root.'
        selected: true
      - option: 'joke.md'
        description: 'Lowercase filename. Less conventional for root-level markdown but more understated.'
        selected: false
      - option: 'JOKES.md'
        description: 'Plural form, implies a collection. Better if multiple jokes will be added over time.'
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: 'JOKE.md follows the uppercase convention used by README.md in the repo root and clearly signals this is a standalone root-level document.'
    answer: 'JOKE.md'

  - question: 'What joke format should be used?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Setup and punchline'
        description: 'Classic two-part joke structure (Q: Why did...? A: Because...). Simple, universally understood.'
        selected: true
      - option: 'One-liner'
        description: 'Single sentence joke. Very concise but may feel too minimal for a dedicated file.'
        selected: false
      - option: 'Short story format'
        description: 'A few sentences building to a punchline. More content but risks overcomplicating a trivial task.'
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: 'A setup-and-punchline format is the most recognizable joke structure, reads well in markdown, and matches the "short, silly joke" requirement.'
    answer: 'Setup and punchline'

  - question: 'Should the file include a markdown heading/title?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Yes, with a title heading'
        description: 'Include an H1 heading like "# Joke" before the joke text. Follows markdown best practices.'
        selected: true
      - option: 'No, just the joke text'
        description: 'Raw joke content only. Minimal but lacks structure expected of a .md file.'
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: 'A heading makes the file a well-formed markdown document and renders nicely on GitHub.'
    answer: 'Yes, with a title heading'

  ## Problem Statement

  The user wants a simple, short markdown file with a silly joke added to the repository root. No code changes, no architecture decisions — just a fun markdown file.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] A file named `JOKE.md` exists in the repo root
  - [ ] The file contains valid markdown with a heading and a short joke
  - [ ] The joke uses a setup-and-punchline format
  - [ ] The file renders correctly when viewed on GitHub (well-formed markdown)
  - [ ] No existing files are modified

  ## Functional Requirements

  - **FR-1**: Create a new file `JOKE.md` in the repository root directory
  - **FR-2**: The file must contain an H1 markdown heading (e.g., `# Joke`)
  - **FR-3**: The file must contain a short, silly joke in setup-and-punchline format
  - **FR-4**: The joke must be appropriate (clean, inoffensive humor)

  ## Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR-1**: The file must be valid markdown that renders correctly on GitHub
  - **NFR-2**: The file must use UTF-8 encoding
  - **NFR-3**: The file must end with a trailing newline (POSIX convention)

  ## Product Questions & AI Recommendations

  | 3 | Include a heading? | Yes, with a title heading | Well-formed markdown, renders nicely on GitHub |

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | repo root | Low | Adding a single new markdown file |

  ## Dependencies

  None.

  ## Size Estimate
