# Implementation Plan (YAML)
# This is the source of truth. Markdown is auto-generated from this file.

name: joke-markdown
summary: >
  Create a single JOKE.md file in the repository root containing a short, silly joke
  with an H1 heading and setup-and-punchline format. No code changes, no tests, no
  architecture impact — just a well-formed markdown file following existing repo conventions.

  ## Architecture Overview

  No architectural impact. This adds a standalone markdown file to the repo root,
  sitting alongside README.md. No integration points, no imports, no dependencies.

  ## Key Design Decisions

  ### File Naming and Location
  **Chosen:** `JOKE.md` at repo root.
  Matches the uppercase convention used by `README.md`. Explicitly required by the spec.

  ### Markdown Structure
  **Chosen:** Single H1 heading followed by setup-and-punchline joke text.
  Mirrors how README.md starts with `# Sheep`. Minimal structure that meets all requirements
  without overengineering (no sub-headings like `## Setup` / `## Punchline`).

  ### Encoding and Line Endings
  **Chosen:** UTF-8 with LF line endings and trailing newline.
  Consistent with all existing repo files. Satisfies NFR-2 and NFR-3.

  ## Implementation Strategy

  Single phase, single task. Create the file, verify it's valid markdown. Done.

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | File already exists | Check before creating; unlikely given current repo state |
  | Invalid markdown | Use simple, standard markdown syntax only |
