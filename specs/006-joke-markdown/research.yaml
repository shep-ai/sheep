name: joke-markdown
summary: >
  Trivial content-only task requiring creation of a single JOKE.md file at the repo root.
  No libraries, no code changes, no architecture impact. The only decisions involve
  markdown formatting conventions consistent with the existing README.md.

decisions:
  - title: 'File Location and Naming'
    chosen: 'JOKE.md in the repository root'
    rejected:
      - 'docs/JOKE.md — Rejected because the spec explicitly requires the file at repo root, and the repo has no docs/ directory. Root placement matches how README.md is positioned.'
      - 'joke.md (lowercase) — Rejected because the repo uses uppercase convention for root-level markdown files (README.md), and the spec explicitly chose JOKE.md.'
    rationale: >
      The spec requires JOKE.md at the repo root. This matches the existing convention
      where README.md is uppercase at the root level. The file will appear alongside
      README.md in the repo root directory listing.

  - title: 'Markdown Structure and Formatting'
    chosen: 'Single H1 heading followed by the joke in setup-and-punchline format'
    rejected:
      - 'No heading, raw joke text only — Rejected because the spec requires an H1 heading, and headless markdown renders poorly on GitHub (no title in preview).'
      - 'Multiple sections with H2 subheadings (e.g., ## Setup, ## Punchline) — Rejected as overengineered for a single short joke. Adds unnecessary structure that makes the joke less natural to read.'
    rationale: >
      A single H1 heading (e.g., "# Joke") followed by the joke text is the simplest
      well-formed markdown structure. This mirrors how README.md starts with "# Sheep"
      and keeps the file minimal while meeting all spec requirements.

  - title: 'Line Ending and Encoding'
    chosen: 'UTF-8 encoding with LF line endings and trailing newline'
    rejected:
      - 'CRLF line endings — Rejected because the existing repo files use LF (Unix-style) line endings. CRLF would be inconsistent and could cause git diff noise.'
      - 'No trailing newline — Rejected because POSIX convention (explicitly required by NFR-3) and the existing repo files all end with trailing newlines.'
    rationale: >
      Consistent with all existing files in the repo. UTF-8 is the universal standard
      for text files, LF matches the repo convention, and a trailing newline satisfies
      POSIX requirements specified in NFR-3.

openQuestions:
  - question: 'What specific joke should be used?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Programming/tech joke'
        description: 'A joke related to programming or technology. Fits the context of a software repo but may feel cliché.'
        selected: true
      - option: 'General silly joke'
        description: 'A non-technical joke (e.g., animal pun, food joke). Universally accessible but less contextually relevant.'
        selected: false
      - option: 'Sheep-themed joke'
        description: 'A joke about sheep, tying into the repo name "Sheep". Creative tie-in but may feel forced.'
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      A programming joke fits naturally in a software repository. However, a sheep-themed
      joke would also be a strong choice given the repo name. The implementer should feel
      free to choose either a programming joke or a sheep-themed joke — both are appropriate.
      The spec says "short, silly joke" without restricting the topic.
    answer: 'A short programming or sheep-themed joke, at the implementer''s discretion'

  ## Status

  - **Phase:** Research Complete
  - **Updated:** 2026-02-23

  ## Technology Decisions

  ### 1. File Location and Naming

  **Chosen:** JOKE.md in the repository root

  **Rejected:**
  - `docs/JOKE.md` — No docs/ directory exists; spec requires root placement matching README.md convention
  - `joke.md` (lowercase) — Inconsistent with existing uppercase README.md at repo root

  **Rationale:** Follows existing repo convention (uppercase .md files at root) and matches the explicit spec requirement.

  ### 2. Markdown Structure and Formatting

  **Chosen:** Single H1 heading followed by the joke in setup-and-punchline format

  **Rejected:**
  - No heading — Spec requires H1; renders poorly on GitHub without a title
  - Multiple sections (## Setup, ## Punchline) — Overengineered; makes the joke unnatural to read

  **Rationale:** Mirrors README.md structure (starts with H1). Minimal, well-formed markdown that meets all requirements.

  ### 3. Line Ending and Encoding

  **Chosen:** UTF-8 with LF line endings and trailing newline

  **Rejected:**
  - CRLF — Inconsistent with existing repo files
  - No trailing newline — Violates POSIX convention required by NFR-3

  **Rationale:** Consistent with all existing files in the repo and satisfies NFR-2 and NFR-3.

  ## Library Analysis

  | Library | Purpose | Decision | Reasoning |
  | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
  | N/A | No libraries needed | N/A | This is a content-only task — just creating a static markdown file |

  ## Security Considerations

  No security implications. This task creates a single static markdown file with no executable content, no user input handling, and no data processing. Markdown files are rendered safely by GitHub's sanitized renderer.

  ## Performance Implications

  No performance implications. A single small markdown file (~100 bytes) has zero impact on build times, runtime performance, or repository size.

  ## Architecture Notes

  This feature has no architectural impact. It adds a standalone markdown file to the repo root with no integration points, no imports, no dependencies, and no effect on the existing codebase. The file sits alongside README.md as a standalone document.

  ## Implementation Notes

  The implementation is straightforward:
  1. Create `JOKE.md` in the repo root
  2. Add an H1 heading (e.g., `# Joke`)
  3. Add a short setup-and-punchline joke
  4. Ensure the file ends with a trailing newline
  5. Verify the file renders correctly as markdown

  Estimated implementation: ~1 minute. No tests required, no CI changes needed.
