# Research Artifact (YAML)
# This is the source of truth. Markdown is auto-generated from this file.

name: random-empty-file
summary: >
  Adding EMPTY.md to the repository root is a zero-complexity change requiring only a
  single `touch` command and a git commit. No libraries, no code changes, and no
  architectural decisions are needed beyond file naming, which follows the established
  uppercase markdown convention (README.md, JOKE.md).

# Structured technology decisions
decisions:
  - title: 'File Creation Method'
    chosen: 'touch EMPTY.md at repository root'
    rejected:
      - 'echo "" > EMPTY.md — writes a newline byte, violating the zero-bytes requirement'
      - 'Write tool / programmatic creation — unnecessary overhead for a trivial shell operation'
    rationale: >
      `touch EMPTY.md` is the canonical POSIX command for creating a zero-byte file.
      It produces exactly 0 bytes of content, satisfying FR-2. The alternative `echo ""`
      would write a newline character (1 byte), violating the spec. Programmatic file
      creation via Python or a script is unnecessary indirection for a single shell command.

  - title: 'File Naming Convention'
    chosen: 'EMPTY.md'
    rejected:
      - 'empty.txt — lowercase breaks the uppercase naming convention already present in README.md and JOKE.md'
      - 'random.txt — ambiguous name that does not communicate intent and introduces a new lowercase file-type convention'
    rationale: >
      The repository root contains README.md and JOKE.md, both uppercase markdown files.
      EMPTY.md matches this established pattern exactly. The .md extension is irrelevant
      for an empty file but keeps the directory listing visually consistent without
      introducing a new file-type convention. This decision was pre-resolved in the spec.

  - title: 'Commit Strategy'
    chosen: 'Single focused commit with conventional commit message'
    rejected:
      - 'Squash into an existing commit — would conflate unrelated changes and obscure history'
      - 'Multiple commits — unnecessary for a one-file, zero-content addition'
    rationale: >
      The spec (NFR-2) explicitly requires a single focused commit. The repository uses
      conventional commit messages (e.g., "feat: add second joke..."). A message like
      `feat: add empty EMPTY.md file` follows this pattern and clearly communicates the
      intent. One file, one commit keeps the diff minimal and CI green.

# Open questions (should be resolved by end of research)
openQuestions:
  - question: 'Does the CI pipeline require any changes to accommodate a new root-level file?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: No CI changes needed
        description: >
          The GitHub Actions workflow only lints/tests Python source under src/ and
          does not scan or validate arbitrary root-level markdown files. EMPTY.md
          will not trigger any workflow step.
        selected: true
      - option: Add a CI step to verify the file is empty
        description: >
          A new workflow step could assert `wc -c EMPTY.md` returns 0. This would
          guard against accidental content being added later but adds maintenance
          overhead for a trivial invariant.
        selected: false
      - option: Update .gitignore or CI ignore lists
        description: >
          If CI tools (linters, spell-checkers) glob *.md they might warn on an empty
          file. The mitigation would be to add EMPTY.md to ignore lists. However,
          inspecting the existing workflow shows no such tool is configured.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      The existing CI workflow (GitHub Actions + Docker) targets Python source files
      and does not process root-level markdown files. No workflow file references *.md
      globs or markdown linters. Adding CI verification for a zero-byte file would be
      over-engineering for zero benefit. No CI changes are required.

  ## Status

  - **Phase:** Research
  - **Updated:** 2026-02-25

  ## Technology Decisions

  ### 1. File Creation Method

  **Chosen:** `touch EMPTY.md` at repository root

  **Rejected:**
  - `echo "" > EMPTY.md` — writes a newline byte (1 byte), violating the zero-bytes requirement (FR-2)
  - Programmatic/scripted creation — unnecessary indirection for a trivial shell operation

  **Rationale:** `touch` is the canonical POSIX tool for creating zero-byte files.
  It is available in every Unix environment including the CI runner. No other tool
  is needed.

  ### 2. File Naming Convention

  **Chosen:** `EMPTY.md`

  **Rejected:**
  - `empty.txt` — lowercase, breaks the uppercase markdown convention (README.md, JOKE.md)
  - `random.txt` — ambiguous name, introduces a new lowercase file-type convention

  **Rationale:** The repository root uses uppercase markdown filenames exclusively.
  EMPTY.md is consistent with README.md and JOKE.md, keeping the directory visually
  uniform. This was pre-resolved in the spec's open questions.

  ### 3. Commit Strategy

  **Chosen:** Single focused commit with conventional commit message

  **Rejected:**
  - Squash into existing commit — conflates unrelated changes
  - Multiple commits — unjustified for a single zero-content file

  **Rationale:** NFR-2 requires a single focused commit. The repo's conventional commit
  history (e.g., `feat: add second joke...`) sets the pattern. A message such as
  `feat: add empty EMPTY.md file` is appropriately scoped.

  ## Library Analysis

  | Library | Purpose | Decision | Reasoning |
  | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
  | None    | N/A     | N/A      | Zero-byte file creation requires no libraries |

  ## Security Considerations

  None. An empty file introduces no executable code, no secrets, no attack surface,
  and no data. It cannot be parsed, executed, or imported by any tool.

  ## Performance Implications

  None. A zero-byte file has negligible impact on filesystem performance, git index
  size, and clone time. No caching or optimization is required.

  ## Architecture Notes

  This change is entirely outside the Python package (`src/sheep/`) and has no
  impact on imports, packaging, or runtime behavior. It lives only at the repository
  root alongside README.md and JOKE.md. The pattern is identical to the JOKE.md
  addition in feature 006/007 — a standalone file committed directly to the root
  with no supporting code changes.
