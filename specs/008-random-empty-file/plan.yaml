# Implementation Plan (YAML)
# This is the source of truth. Markdown is auto-generated from this file.

name: random-empty-file
summary: >
  Add a single zero-byte file named EMPTY.md to the repository root, following the
  established uppercase markdown convention (README.md, JOKE.md). The entire change
  is one shell command plus a focused git commit. No code, no tests, no CI changes.

      Create the zero-byte EMPTY.md at the repository root using `touch`, then stage
      and commit it with a conventional commit message. This is the only phase because
      the entire feature is a single atomic operation with no dependencies or follow-up

  ## Architecture Overview

  This feature has no architectural surface. EMPTY.md is a standalone zero-byte file
  placed at the repository root alongside README.md and JOKE.md. It lives entirely
  outside the Python package (`src/sheep/`) and has no relationship to any module,
  import, or runtime component. The pattern is identical to the JOKE.md addition in
  features 006 and 007 — a standalone file committed directly to the root with no
  supporting code changes.

  ## Key Design Decisions

  ### 1. File Creation Method: `touch EMPTY.md`
  - **Chosen:** `touch EMPTY.md` (POSIX canonical zero-byte file creation)
  - **Rejected:** `echo "" > EMPTY.md` — writes a newline byte (1 byte), violating FR-2
  - **Rejected:** Programmatic/scripted creation — unnecessary indirection for a trivial shell op
  - **Rationale:** `touch` is the only tool that guarantees exactly 0 bytes of output.
    It is available in every Unix environment including the CI runner.

  ### 2. File Naming: `EMPTY.md`
  - **Chosen:** EMPTY.md
  - **Rejected:** `empty.txt` — lowercase, breaks uppercase convention
  - **Rejected:** `random.txt` — ambiguous, introduces a new naming pattern
  - **Rationale:** The repository root uses uppercase markdown exclusively (README.md,
    JOKE.md). EMPTY.md matches this pattern without introducing any new convention.
    Pre-resolved in the feature spec.

  ### 3. Commit Strategy: Single focused commit
  - **Chosen:** One commit, conventional message (`feat: add empty EMPTY.md file`)
  - **Rejected:** Multiple commits — unjustified for a one-file, zero-content addition
  - **Rationale:** NFR-2 mandates a single focused commit. The repo history uses
    conventional commit messages; this change follows the same pattern.

  ### 4. CI Impact: None
  - The GitHub Actions workflow targets Python source under `src/` and does not process
    root-level markdown files. No workflow file references `*.md` globs or markdown linters.
    EMPTY.md will pass CI unchanged.

  ## Implementation Strategy

  Single phase, single task. The entire feature is executed as:
  1. `touch EMPTY.md` at the repository root
  2. `git add EMPTY.md`
  3. `git commit -m "feat: add empty EMPTY.md file"`

  Phase ordering rationale: there is nothing to set up, no dependencies to install,
  and no code to test. The work is completed in one step.

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | File accidentally gets content | Use `touch` (not `echo`); verify with `wc -c EMPTY.md` returning 0 before committing |
  | Wrong location | Run command from repository root; confirm with `ls EMPTY.md` |
  | CI breakage | No workflow changes needed; CI does not scan root markdown files |
