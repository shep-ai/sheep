    title: 'Create and commit EMPTY.md at repository root'
    description: >
      Use `touch EMPTY.md` to create a zero-byte file at the repository root, verify
      it is truly empty, then stage and commit it with a conventional commit message.
      This is the complete implementation of the feature.

  ## Summary

  The entire feature is a single atomic operation: create a zero-byte EMPTY.md at the
  repository root and commit it. There is no code to write, no tests to run, and no
  dependencies to resolve. TDD does not apply — there is no logic to test, only a file's
  existence and byte count to verify manually before committing.

  The task is: `touch EMPTY.md && wc -c EMPTY.md && git add EMPTY.md && git commit`.
