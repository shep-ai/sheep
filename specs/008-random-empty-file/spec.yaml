oneLiner: Add a single empty file to the repository root
userQuery: >
  Feature: add random empty file! SUPER FAST!
summary: >
  Create one empty file in the repository root. This is a trivial, content-free addition
  with no code changes, no logic, and no tests required. The feature follows the same
  pattern as prior simple file additions (JOKE.md) and has minimal blast radius.
  The file will be named EMPTY.md, consistent with the uppercase markdown convention
  already established in the repository.

          Uppercase markdown convention matching README.md and JOKE.md. Immediately visible
          in directory listings. Consistent with the existing repo-root file naming pattern.
          Markdown extension is harmless for an empty file and fits the established style.

        description: >
          Plain text, lowercase. Signals no content is expected via .txt extension.
          However, it breaks the uppercase naming convention already present in the repo root.

      - option: random.txt
        description: >
          Reflects the "random" wording in the feature request. However, the name is
          ambiguous about intent and doesn't follow the uppercase convention.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      EMPTY.md is recommended because the repository root already follows an uppercase
      markdown convention (README.md, JOKE.md). Matching this pattern keeps the directory
      visually consistent. The .md extension is irrelevant for an empty file but aligns
      with the repo's existing style without introducing a new file-type convention.
    answer: EMPTY.md

  ## Problem Statement

  The user wants a random empty file added to the repository as quickly as possible.
  No functional requirement beyond the file's existence. This mirrors the pattern of
  prior trivial file-addition features (006-joke-markdown, 007-joke-markdown-2) where
  a small standalone file was committed to the repository root.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] A file named `EMPTY.md` exists at the repository root (`/EMPTY.md`)
  - [ ] The file has zero bytes (is completely empty)
  - [ ] The file is tracked by git (appears in `git ls-files`)
  - [ ] No existing files are modified
  - [ ] CI passes without errors after the file is added

  ## Functional Requirements

  - **FR-1**: A new file named `EMPTY.md` must be created at the repository root.
  - **FR-2**: The file must be empty — it must contain zero bytes and no content of any kind.
  - **FR-3**: The file must be committed to the git repository and tracked under version control.
  - **FR-4**: No other files in the repository may be modified as part of this change.

  ## Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR-1**: The filename must follow the existing uppercase markdown convention used by `README.md` and `JOKE.md`.
  - **NFR-2**: The change must be a single focused commit with a clear commit message.
  - **NFR-3**: CI/GitHub Actions must continue to pass without modification to any workflow files.

  ## Product Questions & AI Recommendations

  | # | Question | AI Recommendation | Rationale |
  | - | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
  | 1 | What should the empty file be named? | EMPTY.md | Matches the uppercase markdown convention already established by README.md and JOKE.md in the repository root. |

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | Repository root | Low | One new empty file added; no existing files modified |
  | CI/GitHub Actions | None | Workflow does not lint or test arbitrary root files |
  | Python package | None | File is not inside `src/sheep/`; no import or packaging impact |

  ## Dependencies

  None. The file has no content, no imports, and no runtime dependencies.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — This is a single `touch EMPTY.md` + `git add` + `git commit`. Effort is
  measured in seconds, not hours. All questions are resolved; implementation is unblocked.
