name: joke-markdown-file-2
summary: >
  JOKE2.md is a trivial new file at the repository root — no code, libraries, or
  infrastructure changes are required. The key finding is that the spec's selected joke
  ("Why do programmers prefer dark mode?") already appears in JOKE.md, so a different
  joke must be chosen. The file should mirror JOKE.md's structure exactly: H1 heading,
  bold Q/A format, horizontal rule, UTF-8 with trailing newline.

  - title: 'Joke Content Selection'
    chosen: >
      "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't C#!" — a clean,
      workplace-safe pun using two well-known languages.
    rejected:
      - '"Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!" — already
        present verbatim in JOKE.md (lines 3-5); using it again would be a duplicate.'
      - '"There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and
        those who don''t." — widely overused; lower novelty value for a repository
        that already has a quality joke.'
    rationale: >
      The existing JOKE.md already contains the spec-recommended joke, so it cannot be
      reused without creating a duplicate. The Java/C# pun is concise (fits in one line),
      requires no explanation, is universally understood by developers across language
      communities, and is workplace-appropriate. It also fits the existing Q/A bold format
      without modification.

  - title: 'File Structure and Formatting'
    chosen: >
      Mirror JOKE.md exactly: `# Joke` H1 heading, blank line, bold `**Q:**`/`**A:**`
      format, horizontal rule (`---`), trailing newline, UTF-8 encoding.
    rejected:
      - 'Plain text only (no heading, no bold markup) — violates NFR-1 and FR-4;
        inconsistent with JOKE.md which uses heading + bold Q/A.'
      - 'Different heading text (e.g., `# Joke 2`) — unnecessary divergence from the
        established pattern; the spec explicitly requires matching JOKE.md structure.'
    rationale: >
      JOKE.md (lines 1-10) uses `# Joke`, blank lines for readability, `**Q:**`/`**A:**`
      bold labels, and a `---` horizontal rule. Matching this exactly satisfies FR-4
      (consistent Markdown formatting), NFR-3 (UTF-8 with trailing newline), and the
      spec requirement to follow JOKE.md structural patterns. Deviating would introduce
      inconsistency with no benefit.

  - title: 'File Placement'
    chosen: 'Repository root — `/JOKE2.md`'
    rejected:
      - 'Subdirectory (e.g., `docs/JOKE2.md`) — contradicts FR-1 which specifies
        the repository root, and breaks symmetry with JOKE.md at the root.'
      - 'Alternate name (e.g., `JOKES2.md`, `JOKE_2.md`) — FR-1 explicitly names
        the file `JOKE2.md`; any variation is non-compliant.'
    rationale: >
      FR-1 is unambiguous: "A new file named `JOKE2.md` MUST be created at the
      repository root." JOKE.md already lives at the root, so `/JOKE2.md` maintains
      symmetry and discoverability. No other placement is valid.

openQuestions:
  - question: >
      The spec-selected joke already exists in JOKE.md. Which replacement joke
      should be used in JOKE2.md?
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Java/C# pun: "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don''t C#!"'
        description: >
          Short single-line Q/A. References two mainstream languages (Java, C#). The
          punchline is a visual/phonetic pun on "see sharp". Clean, workplace-safe,
          widely understood by developers regardless of language background.
        selected: true
      - option: 'Git pun: "Why did the developer go broke? Because he used up all his cache."'
        description: >
          References a near-universal concept (caching/cash). Slightly longer punchline.
          Works well standalone but is slightly more of a stretch as a programming joke
          versus a general tech joke.
        selected: false
      - option: 'Recursion joke: "In order to understand recursion, you must first understand recursion."'
        description: >
          A classic CS concept joke presented as a statement rather than Q/A format.
          Would require a minor structural variation (no Q/A bold labels), which
          deviates from JOKE.md established pattern.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      The Java/C# pun maps cleanly onto the existing `**Q:**`/`**A:**` bold format used
      in JOKE.md without any structural adaptation. It is concise (satisfies NFR-2:
      3 lines excluding heading), workplace-safe (satisfies FR-3), and involves a
      genuine programming-language reference (satisfies FR-2). The other options either
      require structural deviation or are less precisely "programming" jokes.

  ## Technology Decisions

  ### 1. Joke Content Selection

  **Chosen:** "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't C#!"

  **Rejected:**
  - "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!" — already in JOKE.md verbatim (lines 3–5); cannot be reused.
  - "There are 10 types of people..." — overused; lower novelty.

  **Rationale:** The spec's recommended joke is already present in JOKE.md, making a
  replacement necessary. The Java/C# pun is concise, clean, and fits the existing Q/A
  format without modification.

  ### 2. File Structure and Formatting

  **Chosen:** Mirror JOKE.md exactly — `# Joke` H1, `**Q:**`/`**A:**` bold labels, `---` rule, trailing newline, UTF-8.

  **Rejected:**
  - Plain text only — violates FR-4 and NFR-1; inconsistent with JOKE.md.
  - Different heading text — unnecessary divergence from established pattern.

  **Rationale:** Exact structural parity with JOKE.md satisfies FR-4, NFR-3, and the
  spec's explicit consistency requirement.

  ### 3. File Placement

  **Chosen:** Repository root — `/JOKE2.md`

  **Rejected:**
  - Subdirectory — contradicts FR-1.
  - Alternate filename — FR-1 is explicit about the name `JOKE2.md`.

  **Rationale:** FR-1 is unambiguous and JOKE.md already lives at the root.

  ## Library Analysis

  | Library | Purpose | Decision | Reasoning |
  | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
  | None    | N/A     | N/A      | Pure Markdown file; no libraries, build tools, or runtime dependencies required. |

  ## Security Considerations

  None. A static Markdown file with joke text has no attack surface, introduces no
  dependencies, and requires no authentication or authorization changes. The content
  is plaintext with no executable code, scripts, or external references.

  ## Performance Implications

  None. A small (~100 byte) static file adds negligible repository size. No build
  pipeline changes, no runtime impact.

  ## Architecture Notes

  This feature is purely additive — one new file at the repository root with zero
  impact on existing code, configuration, CI/CD, or infrastructure. It follows the
  identical pattern established by feature 007 (JOKE.md). No integration points,
  data model changes, or API surface modifications are involved.

  The only non-obvious finding: the spec's selected joke duplicates existing JOKE.md
  content and must be replaced before implementation.
