  - question: 'Which joke should be used in JOKE2.md?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Why do programmers prefer dark mode?'
        description: >
          Classic, widely-known programming humor. Punchline: "Because light attracts bugs!"
          Safe, relatable, and consistent with the lighthearted tone of JOKE.md.
        selected: true
      - option: 'A different original joke'
        description: >
          Use a less common joke to avoid overlap with well-known content. Slightly riskier
          since originality is harder to verify and may not land as well.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!" is universally
      understood by developers, clean, and matches the tone of the existing JOKE.md.
      It requires no explanation and works standalone in a markdown file.
    answer: 'Why do programmers prefer dark mode?'

  - question: 'Should JOKE2.md include a title heading?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Include H1 title heading'
        description: >
          Adds a `# Joke` or similar H1 heading before the joke text, mirroring any
          structure present in JOKE.md and making the file self-descriptive.
        selected: true
      - option: 'Joke text only, no heading'
        description: >
          Plain joke text with no markdown heading. Simpler, but less consistent if
          JOKE.md uses a heading.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      JOKE.md uses a heading structure. Matching it keeps the two files consistent and
      makes JOKE2.md self-descriptive when viewed on GitHub or in a markdown renderer.
    answer: 'Include H1 title heading'

  ## Problem Statement

  The repository currently has one joke markdown file (JOKE.md). This feature adds a second
  joke markdown file (JOKE2.md) with another short, lighthearted programming joke, continuing
  the tradition established by feature 007.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] JOKE2.md exists at the repository root
  - [ ] JOKE2.md contains exactly one short, self-contained programming joke
  - [ ] The joke is appropriate and workplace-safe
  - [ ] The file uses valid Markdown syntax
  - [ ] JOKE2.md follows the same structural pattern as JOKE.md (heading + joke body)
  - [ ] No existing files are modified

  ## Functional Requirements

  - **FR-1**: A new file named `JOKE2.md` MUST be created at the repository root.
  - **FR-2**: The file MUST contain at least one programming-themed joke.
  - **FR-3**: The joke content MUST be appropriate for a professional/workplace context.
  - **FR-4**: The file MUST use valid Markdown formatting consistent with JOKE.md.
  - **FR-5**: No other files in the repository MAY be modified as part of this feature.

  ## Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR-1**: The file MUST be human-readable without a Markdown renderer (plain text fallback).
  - **NFR-2**: The joke MUST be short — no more than 3 lines of content excluding the heading.
  - **NFR-3**: The file MUST use UTF-8 encoding with a trailing newline.

  ## Product Questions & AI Recommendations

  | # | Question | AI Recommendation | Rationale |
  | - | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
  | 1 | Which joke to use? | "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!" | Classic, clean, universally understood by developers |
  | 2 | Include a title heading? | Yes, include H1 heading | Matches JOKE.md structure; self-descriptive in GitHub rendering |

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | JOKE2.md (new file) | Low | New standalone markdown file at repo root |

  ## Dependencies

  None.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Create a single markdown file with one joke. No code, no tests, no configuration.
