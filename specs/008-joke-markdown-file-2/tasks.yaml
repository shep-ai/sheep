  ## Summary

  One file, one task, one phase. The implementation writes JOKE2.md to the
  repository root using the Java/C# pun ("Why do Java developers wear glasses?
  Because they don't C#!"), mirroring JOKE.md's structure exactly.

  TDD is not applicable — this is a pure Markdown file with no executable code,
  no functions, and no test harness.

  The only non-obvious subtlety handled before this task: the spec-recommended
  joke was pre-empted by research findings showing it already exists verbatim
  in JOKE.md, so the replacement joke is baked into task-1's acceptance criteria.
