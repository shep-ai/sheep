# Implementation Plan (YAML)
# This is the source of truth. Markdown is auto-generated from this file.

name: joke-markdown-file-2
summary: >
  Create JOKE2.md at the repository root, mirroring JOKE.md's structure exactly:
  H1 heading, blank line, bold Q/A format, horizontal rule, trailing newline, UTF-8.
  Joke content is the Java/C# pun — the spec-selected joke already exists verbatim
  in JOKE.md and cannot be reused.

  ## Status

  - **Phase:** Planning
  - **Updated:** 2026-02-26

  ## Architecture Overview

  This feature is purely additive. One new file at the repository root with zero
  impact on existing code, configuration, CI/CD, or infrastructure. It follows the
  identical pattern established by feature 007 (JOKE.md).

  JOKE.md structure (observed in file):

  ```
  # Joke

  **Q:** Why do programmers prefer dark mode?

  **A:** Because light attracts bugs.

  ---
  ```

  JOKE2.md will match this structure exactly: H1 heading, blank line, bold Q/A
  labels, blank lines for readability, horizontal rule, trailing newline, UTF-8.

  ## Key Design Decisions

  **Joke content:** "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't C#!"

  The spec-recommended joke ("Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light
  attracts bugs!") is already verbatim in JOKE.md lines 3–5 and cannot be reused
  without creating a duplicate. The Java/C# pun:
  - Maps cleanly onto the existing **Q:**/**A:** bold format
  - Is concise (satisfies NFR-2: ≤3 content lines excluding heading)
  - Is workplace-safe (satisfies FR-3)
  - References two mainstream programming languages (satisfies FR-2)

  **File structure:** Mirror JOKE.md exactly — `# Joke` H1, `**Q:**`/`**A:**`
  bold labels, `---` horizontal rule, UTF-8 with trailing newline. Deviating would
  introduce inconsistency for no benefit and would violate FR-4.

  **File placement:** Repository root per FR-1, matching JOKE.md placement.

  ## Implementation Strategy

  One phase, one task: write the file. No ordering complexity required.
  The only non-trivial decision (joke selection) is already resolved by research
  findings — the spec-default joke duplicates existing content and was replaced.

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | Duplicate joke content with JOKE.md | Use Java/C# pun instead of spec-selected joke |
  | Trailing newline missing | Ensure file content string ends with \n |
  | Structural drift from JOKE.md | Match heading, blank lines, Q/A format, and rule exactly |
  | Wrong file name or location | Create at repo root as JOKE2.md per FR-1 |
