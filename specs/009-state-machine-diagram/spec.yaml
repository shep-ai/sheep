oneLiner: Add a markdown file with a Mermaid state machine diagram
summary: >
  Create a short markdown file (STATE_MACHINE.md) at the repo root containing a
  Mermaid stateDiagram-v2 diagram of a simple random state machine. Follows the
  same convention as existing content files (DESIGN_PATTERN.md, JOKE.md, SHEEP.md).

  ## Problem Statement

  The repository lacks an example of a state machine diagram. The request is to
  create a simple, standalone markdown file with a Mermaid state diagram — no
  research required, no external dependencies, just a quick content addition.

  ## Codebase Analysis

  ### Project Structure

  | Path | Purpose |
  | ---- | ------- |
  | `*.md` (root) | Standalone content/documentation files (JOKE.md, SHEEP.md, DESIGN_PATTERN.md) |
  | `specs/` | Per-feature spec YAMLs managed by the agent workflow |
  | `src/sheep/` | Python source for the Sheep agentic platform |
  | `tests/` | Python test suite |

  ### Architecture Patterns

  Content markdown files live at the repository root alongside README.md. They are
  standalone documents with no code coupling. Existing examples follow a short,
  focused format: a title heading, a brief prose intro, and the main content body.

  ### Relevant Technologies

  - **Markdown** — standard .md format used for all content files
  - **Mermaid stateDiagram-v2** — GitHub-native diagram syntax rendered in markdown;
    requires no build step or extra tooling

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | `STATE_MACHINE.md` (new file, repo root) | Low | New standalone content file, no code changes |

  ## Dependencies

  None. Mermaid diagrams are rendered natively by GitHub and most markdown viewers.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Single new markdown file, ~30 lines. No code changes, no tests needed.
