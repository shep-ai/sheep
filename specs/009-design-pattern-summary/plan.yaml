# Implementation Plan (YAML)
# This is the source of truth. Markdown is auto-generated from this file.

name: design-pattern-summary
summary: >
  Pure content task: create a single Markdown file (DESIGN_PATTERN_SUMMARY.md) at the
  repository root documenting the Strategy design pattern. The file follows the structural
  conventions established by DESIGN_PATTERN.md (Observer pattern) — same logical section
  order, same abc.ABC interface style in the Python example, same UPPER_SNAKE_CASE root
  placement. No source code, no tests, no CI changes. One phase, one file.

# Structured implementation phases

  - id: phase-1
    name: 'Content Authoring'
    description: >
      Draft and finalize DESIGN_PATTERN_SUMMARY.md in a single authoring pass. All
      functional requirements (FR-1 through FR-10) and non-functional requirements
      (NFR-1 through NFR-5) are addressed within this one phase. The phase ends when
      the file passes all acceptance criteria: correct placement, line count in range,
      all required sections present, Python example syntactically valid.

  ## Status

  - **Phase:** Planning
  - **Updated:** 2026-02-26

  ## Architecture Overview

  The repository has a clear convention for prose content files: they live at the root
  level in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`README.md`, `JOKE.md`, `JOKE2.md`, `DESIGN_PATTERN.md`,
  `SHEEP.md`). `DESIGN_PATTERN_SUMMARY.md` continues this convention without introducing
  any new pattern.

  There is no runtime integration — the file is a standalone reference document. The
  Python snippet inside the markdown fence is illustrative only; it is not imported,
  executed, or tested by the project's CI pipeline.

  ## Key Design Decisions

  ### 1. Pattern Choice: Strategy (GoF Behavioral)

  Strategy was selected over Decorator, Factory Method, and Command because it:
  - Complements Observer (also behavioral) by demonstrating algorithm encapsulation
    rather than event propagation — covering different ground without duplication
  - Yields a clean, concise Python example (25-35 lines) using `abc.ABC` + `@abstractmethod`
  - Maps to a canonical, immediately recognizable real-world scenario (payment processing)

  ### 2. Document Structure: Mirror DESIGN_PATTERN.md with Minor Heading Variations

  `DESIGN_PATTERN.md` establishes the only precedent in the repo:

  ```
  H1 title → intro sentence → Overview → Structure → When to Use →
  Trade-offs (Advantages / Disadvantages) → Code Example → Related Patterns
  ```

  The new file follows this exact logical flow. The "Related Patterns" section is omitted
  because it is not required by any FR and would risk pushing the file over the 200-line
  NFR-1 limit. Minor heading wording variations are acceptable per the spec.

  ### 3. Python Example Domain: Payment Processing

  A `Checkout` context object switching between `CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`, and
  `BankTransferPayment` strategies was chosen over:
  - **Sorting strategies** — algorithm implementations exceed 40-line target or become pseudocode
  - **Compression strategies** — rely on third-party library APIs; obscures the pattern mechanics

  Payment processing is the canonical Strategy example: runtime-swappable, no external
  imports beyond `abc`, fits 25-35 lines, and matches `DESIGN_PATTERN.md`'s WeatherStation
  style (ABC interface + concrete implementations + `__main__` demo).

  ### 4. Interface Style: abc.ABC + @abstractmethod

  Consistent with `DESIGN_PATTERN.md`. Provides an explicit interface contract (educational
  value) and requires only the stdlib `abc` module. Duck typing and `typing.Protocol` were
  rejected to maintain stylistic consistency across both pattern files.

  ### 5. Line Count Target: 160-190 Lines

  Budget analysis:

  | Section | Estimated Lines |
  | ------- | --------------- |
  | H1 + intro sentence | ~5 |
  | Overview | ~12 |
  | Structure | ~18 |
  | When to Use (4 use cases) | ~20 |
  | Trade-offs (2 pros + 2 cons) | ~20 |
  | Code Example (narrative + fenced block) | ~45 |
  | Horizontal rules + blank lines | ~20 |
  | **Total** | **~140-160** |

  With separators, landing at approximately 160-180 total — well within NFR-1 (150-200).

  ## Implementation Strategy

  Single-phase content authoring. The file is written section-by-section following the
  logical order established by `DESIGN_PATTERN.md`. After authoring, the file is validated
  against all success criteria: line count, section presence, Python syntax, GFM structure,
  and confirmation that no existing files were modified.

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | File exceeds 200 lines (NFR-1) | Omit Related Patterns section; keep code example to 25-35 lines; keep prose concise |
  | File falls below 150 lines (NFR-1) | Include 4 When to Use entries and 2+2 Trade-offs with substantive explanations |
  | Python example has syntax errors (FR-7) | Use standard Python 3 patterns only; verify code mentally as written |
  | Wrong pattern documented (FR-2) | Strategy confirmed in spec; verify H1 title before commit |
  | Existing files accidentally modified (NFR-4) | Only the Write tool is used on the new file; no Edit calls on existing files |
  | GFM rendering issues (FR-9) | Use standard ATX headings, fenced code blocks with language tag, no exotic GFM extensions |
