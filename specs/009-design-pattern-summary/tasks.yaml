  2 tasks in 1 phase. Task 1 creates DESIGN_PATTERN_SUMMARY.md with all required
  sections and the Python code example. Task 2 validates the file against every
  acceptance criterion before the branch is merged.

# Structured task list
tasks:

    phaseId: phase-1
    title: 'Create DESIGN_PATTERN_SUMMARY.md'
    description: >
      Author the complete DESIGN_PATTERN_SUMMARY.md file at the repository root. The
      file documents the Strategy design pattern following the same section order as
      DESIGN_PATTERN.md: H1 title → intro sentence → Overview → Structure → When to
      Use → Trade-offs → Code Example. The Python example uses a payment-processing
      scenario (Checkout context + CreditCardPayment / PayPalPayment / BankTransferPayment
      strategies) with abc.ABC and @abstractmethod. No Related Patterns section is
      included to stay within the 200-line limit.
    state: Todo
    dependencies: []
    acceptanceCriteria:
      - 'File DESIGN_PATTERN_SUMMARY.md exists at the repository root'
      - 'File is between 150 and 200 lines inclusive'
      - 'File contains an H1 heading with the pattern name (Strategy)'
      - 'File contains a one-sentence intro paragraph immediately after the H1'
      - 'File contains an Overview section describing the pattern''s intent'
      - 'File contains a Structure section listing the participants and their roles'
      - 'File contains a When to Use section with at least 3 distinct, concrete scenarios'
      - 'File contains a Trade-offs section with at least 2 advantages and at least 2 disadvantages'
      - 'File contains a Python code example fenced with ```python'
      - 'Python code example is 20-40 lines and uses a concrete payment-processing scenario'
      - 'Python code example uses abc.ABC + @abstractmethod for the Strategy interface'
      - 'No existing files in the repository have been modified'

  - id: task-2
    phaseId: phase-1
    title: 'Validate DESIGN_PATTERN_SUMMARY.md against all success criteria'
    description: >
      Run a systematic checklist validation of the completed file against every
      success criterion and FR/NFR from the spec. Specifically: verify line count
      with `wc -l`, check all required sections are present, confirm the Python
      code block parses without SyntaxError by extracting it and running
      `python3 -c "compile(...)"` or equivalent, and confirm no other files were
      modified with `git diff --name-only`.
    state: Todo
    dependencies:
      - task-1
    acceptanceCriteria:
      - '`wc -l DESIGN_PATTERN_SUMMARY.md` reports a value between 150 and 200'
      - 'All 6 required sections are present: H1 title, Overview, Structure, When to Use, Trade-offs, Code Example'
      - 'Python snippet extracted from the file runs without SyntaxError under Python 3'
      - 'The documented pattern is not Observer (FR-2)'
      - '`git diff --name-only` shows only DESIGN_PATTERN_SUMMARY.md as a new untracked file'
      - 'File renders correctly in GFM (standard ATX headings, valid fenced code block)'

  ## Summary

  This is a pure content authoring task. There is only one file to create
  (`DESIGN_PATTERN_SUMMARY.md`) and one validation pass to confirm it meets all
  acceptance criteria.

  The work flows in two steps: first author the file section-by-section following
  `DESIGN_PATTERN.md`'s structure (Overview → Structure → When to Use → Trade-offs →
  Code Example), then validate the output against every requirement from the spec —
  line count, section completeness, Python syntax, and a clean `git diff`.

  No TDD cycles apply because this is a documentation task with no executable source
  code. Validation replaces the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR loop: the acceptance criteria
  define what "done" looks like, and the validation task confirms it.
