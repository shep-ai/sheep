# Research Artifact (YAML)
# This is the source of truth. Markdown is auto-generated from this file.

name: joke-md-file-8153cd
summary: >
  This feature requires creating a single new Markdown file (JOKE3.md) at the
  repository root containing one short programming-themed joke. No libraries,
  build tools, or code changes are involved — the only decisions are file
  structure and joke content, both fully determined by existing JOKE.md and
  JOKE2.md conventions.

# Structured technology decisions
decisions:
  - title: 'File Structure and Formatting'
    chosen: >
      Single H1 title "# Joke", one Q&A style joke block, followed by a
      horizontal rule ("---"), matching JOKE2.md exactly.
    rejected:
      - >
        Multiple jokes / extended content — contradicts the user's explicit
        "fast, simple" request and the single-joke pattern established by
        JOKE2.md. Also mismatches NFR-1 which targets minimal structure.
      - >
        No title / raw joke only — JOKE.md and JOKE2.md both open with "# Joke".
        Omitting the header breaks structural consistency without any benefit.
    rationale: >
      Both existing joke files use an H1 "# Joke" heading. JOKE2.md (the most
      recent precedent) contains exactly one Q&A joke followed by "---". FR-3
      and NFR-1 explicitly require a short joke with minimal structure. Matching
      JOKE2.md precisely ensures consistency and satisfies all functional and
      non-functional requirements.

  - title: 'Joke Content Selection'
    chosen: >
      A single short programming/tech-themed Q&A pun distinct from all jokes
      already present in JOKE.md and JOKE2.md.
    rejected:
      - >
        Reusing or paraphrasing an existing joke from JOKE.md or JOKE2.md —
        adds no value, makes the new file redundant, and violates the implicit
        expectation that each file introduces new content.
      - >
        General/non-tech humor — breaks the thematic consistency of the
        repository's joke files, which are all programmer-audience jokes.
        Rejected per FR-4 and spec question resolution.
    rationale: >
      All four existing jokes are programming or technology themed (dark mode/bugs,
      anti-gravity pun, IT support reboot, Java/C# wordplay). A new tech pun
      maintains thematic coherence for the developer audience. FR-4 mandates
      programming/tech content; NFR-2 requires it to be workplace-appropriate.

  ## Status

  - **Phase:** Research
  - **Updated:** 2026-02-26

  ## Technology Decisions

  ### 1. File Structure and Formatting

  **Chosen:** Single H1 `# Joke` title, one Q&A joke, closing `---` — identical
  structure to JOKE2.md.

  **Rejected:**
  - Multiple jokes — contradicts "fast, simple" user intent and JOKE2.md single-joke pattern
  - No title / raw joke only — breaks structural consistency with both existing files

  **Rationale:** JOKE2.md is the most recent and minimal precedent. Replicating
  its structure exactly satisfies FR-5 (valid Markdown), NFR-1 (minimal
  structure), and keeps the file immediately recognisable alongside its siblings.

  ### 2. Joke Content Selection

  **Chosen:** A new, distinct programming/tech Q&A pun not present in JOKE.md
  or JOKE2.md.

  **Rejected:**
  - Reusing existing jokes — redundant, no new value
  - General/non-tech humor — breaks thematic consistency (FR-4)

  **Rationale:** Every existing joke targets a programmer audience. A fresh tech
  pun maintains consistency and satisfies FR-4 and NFR-2 without any code or
  tooling changes.

  ## Library Analysis

  | Library | Purpose | Decision | Reasoning |
  | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
  | None    | N/A     | N/A      | Pure Markdown content file; no libraries, parsers, or build tools required |

  ## Security Considerations

  None. A static Markdown file with plain text joke content has no security
  surface: no user input, no code execution, no external data, no authentication.

  ## Performance Implications

  None. A small text file (~100 bytes) has negligible impact on repository size,
  clone time, or any runtime system.

  ## Architecture Notes

  JOKE3.md is a pure content addition at the repository root following the
  established JOKE.md → JOKE2.md pattern. No impact on source code, tests, CI,
  or configuration. The only integration point is the repository file tree
  itself — no cross-file references or build steps involved.
