oneLiner: Add a new markdown file containing a short stupid joke
userQuery: >
  create simple short md file with stupid joke, fast, no research, no thinking!
summary: >
  This feature adds JOKE3.md at the repository root containing a single short
  stupid joke. The repository already has JOKE.md (three jokes) and JOKE2.md
  (one joke) following the same pattern. Trivial content-only addition with no
  code changes required.

# Open questions (must be resolved before implementation)
openQuestions:
  - question: 'What should the new joke file be named?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'JOKE3.md'
        description: >
          Continues the sequential naming convention established by JOKE.md and
          JOKE2.md. Consistent, predictable, easy to discover. Recommended default.
        selected: true
      - option: 'JOKE_NEW.md'
        description: >
          A descriptive but non-sequential name. Breaks the existing pattern and
          makes future additions harder to name consistently.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      JOKE3.md directly continues the established JOKE.md → JOKE2.md sequence,
      keeping the naming convention consistent and predictable.
    answer: 'JOKE3.md'

  - question: 'How many jokes should JOKE3.md contain?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Single joke'
        description: >
          One short joke. Matches JOKE2.md pattern (single joke), keeps the file
          minimal, and satisfies the user's "fast, no thinking" intent.
        selected: true
      - option: 'Multiple jokes'
        description: >
          Two or more jokes, matching JOKE.md which has three. More content but
          more work and at odds with the user's explicit request for something fast.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      The user explicitly asked for "simple short" and "fast". A single joke
      matches the JOKE2.md pattern and directly satisfies the request.
    answer: 'Single joke'

  - question: 'What style of joke should be used?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Programming/tech pun'
        description: >
          A short programming or tech-themed pun or one-liner, consistent with
          existing jokes in JOKE.md and JOKE2.md (dark mode, anti-gravity, IT
          reboot, Java/C# pun). Keeps the repository thematically coherent.
        selected: true
      - option: 'General humor'
        description: >
          Any type of short joke unrelated to programming. Broadens the content
          but breaks thematic consistency with existing joke files.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      All existing jokes are programming/tech themed. A tech pun maintains
      thematic consistency and fits the developer-audience context of the repo.
    answer: 'Programming/tech pun'

# Markdown content (the actual spec)

  ## Problem Statement

  The repository contains JOKE.md (three programming jokes) and JOKE2.md (one
  Java/C# pun) at the repo root. The user has requested another short stupid joke
  file following the same pattern. This is a trivial content-only addition.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] A file named `JOKE3.md` exists at the repository root
  - [ ] The file contains exactly one short joke
  - [ ] The joke is programming/tech themed, consistent with existing joke files
  - [ ] The file is valid Markdown (renders correctly)
  - [ ] No source code, tests, or configuration files are modified

  ## Functional Requirements

  - **FR-1**: A new file `JOKE3.md` MUST be created at the repository root.
  - **FR-2**: `JOKE3.md` MUST contain at least one joke (a single joke is sufficient).
  - **FR-3**: The joke MUST be short (one or two lines — a setup and punchline, or a one-liner).
  - **FR-4**: The joke content MUST be programming or technology themed for thematic consistency.
  - **FR-5**: The file MUST be valid Markdown and render without errors.

  ## Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR-1**: The file MUST follow the same minimal structure as `JOKE2.md` (no unnecessary headers or metadata beyond a title or the joke itself).
  - **NFR-2**: The joke MUST be inoffensive and workplace-appropriate.
  - **NFR-3**: No existing files (source, tests, configuration, other markdown) are to be modified.

  ## Product Questions & AI Recommendations

  | # | Question | AI Recommendation | Rationale |
  | - | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
  | 1 | What should the new joke file be named? | JOKE3.md | Continues the JOKE.md → JOKE2.md sequential naming pattern |
  | 2 | How many jokes should JOKE3.md contain? | Single joke | Matches JOKE2.md pattern; satisfies user's "fast, simple" intent |
  | 3 | What style of joke should be used? | Programming/tech pun | Maintains thematic consistency with all existing joke files |

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | JOKE3.md (new file) | Low | New markdown file at repo root following JOKE.md/JOKE2.md pattern |

  ## Dependencies

  None. Purely a new content file.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Single new markdown file with one short joke. Minutes of work.
