userQuery: >

summary: >
  This feature adds a new markdown file (e.g. JOKE3.md) containing a short
  stupid joke. The repository already has JOKE.md and JOKE2.md with the same
  pattern. Trivial content-only addition with no code changes required.

  ## Problem Statement

  The repository already contains JOKE.md and JOKE2.md with short programming
  jokes. This feature adds another joke markdown file following the same pattern.

  ## Codebase Analysis

  ### Project Structure
  - `JOKE.md` — three jokes (dark mode, anti-gravity, IT reboot)
  - `JOKE2.md` — one Java/C# pun
  - `SHEEP.md`, `DESIGN_PATTERN.md` — other content markdown files at repo root
  - `src/sheep/` — Python agent framework source (unaffected)
  - `specs/` — feature spec directory
  - `tests/` — Python test suite (unaffected)

  ### Architecture Patterns
  Content-only change. No code, no tests, no configuration needed.

  ### Relevant Technologies
  Markdown only.

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | JOKE3.md (new file) | Low | New markdown file at repo root following JOKE.md/JOKE2.md pattern |

  ## Dependencies

  None. Purely a new content file.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Single new markdown file with one short joke. Minutes of work.
