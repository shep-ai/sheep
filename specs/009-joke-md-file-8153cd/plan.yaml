  Create JOKE3.md at the repository root containing a single short
  programming/tech-themed Q&A joke, matching the minimal structure of JOKE2.md
  exactly: H1 title, bold Q&A block, closing horizontal rule.

      Create JOKE3.md at the repository root with the exact structure of JOKE2.md.
      This is the only phase — there are no code dependencies, build steps, or
      integration points. The file stands alone as a pure content addition.

  ## Status

  - **Phase:** Planning
  - **Updated:** 2026-02-26

  ## Architecture Overview

  JOKE3.md is a pure content addition to the repository root with no impact on
  source code, tests, CI, or configuration. It follows the established pattern:

  - JOKE.md — three programming jokes (H1 title + three Q&A blocks)
  - JOKE2.md — one programming joke (H1 title + one Q&A block + "---")

  JOKE3.md replicates the JOKE2.md structure exactly, as it is the most recent
  and minimal precedent, and because the spec explicitly calls for a single joke
  with minimal structure (NFR-1).

  ## Key Design Decisions

  ### File Structure
  Chosen: `# Joke` H1, one `**Q:**`/`**A:**` joke block, closing `---`.
  Alternative considered: No title / raw joke only — rejected because both
  existing files open with `# Joke`, omitting it would break structural
  consistency without benefit.

  ### Joke Content
  Chosen: A new, distinct programming/tech Q&A pun not already present in
  JOKE.md or JOKE2.md. All four existing jokes are programmer-audience themed
  (dark mode/bugs, anti-gravity, IT reboot, Java/C# wordplay). A fresh tech
  pun maintains thematic coherence and satisfies FR-4 and NFR-2.

  ## Implementation Strategy

  Single phase, single task. There are no dependencies, no code to write, and
  no tests to run. The entire implementation is: create one Markdown file at the
  repo root.

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | Joke already exists in JOKE.md or JOKE2.md | Verify joke content is distinct before committing |
  | File placed in wrong directory | Place at repo root alongside JOKE.md and JOKE2.md |
  | Markdown formatting error | Validate structure matches JOKE2.md exactly |
