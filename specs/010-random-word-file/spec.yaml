oneLiner: Create a txt file containing a single random word
summary: >
  Add a RANDOM_WORD.txt file to the repository root containing a single random
  word. This is a minimal content addition following the same pattern as existing
  root-level content files (JOKE.md, SHEEP.md). The word is selected at
  implementation time and committed as a static file — no runtime generation
  required.

openQuestions:
  - question: 'How should the random word be sourced — hardcoded static value, Python script, or external word list?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Hardcoded static word'
        description: >
          A single English word is chosen by the implementer and committed
          directly as the file content. Simplest approach, zero dependencies,
          consistent with how JOKE.md and SHEEP.md were created. The word does
          not change after commit.
        selected: true
      - option: 'Python script generates word'
        description: >
          A small Python script using the `random` stdlib picks a word from an
          embedded list at commit time and writes RANDOM_WORD.txt. Adds a tiny
          amount of tooling but allows easy regeneration. Still results in a
          static committed file.
        selected: false
      - option: 'External word list / API'
        description: >
          Word is fetched from an external source (e.g., Random Word API or a
          large corpus file). Introduces network dependency or a large asset;
          overkill for this feature size.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      A hardcoded static word is the simplest approach and is perfectly
      consistent with the existing pattern of root-level content files.
      The feature name says "random" in the sense that the word is arbitrarily
      chosen, not that it must be re-randomized on every access. Adding a script
      or external dependency would over-engineer an S-sized task.
    answer: 'Hardcoded static word'

  - question: 'Should a pytest test be added to verify RANDOM_WORD.txt exists and contains exactly one word?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Add a test'
        description: >
          A small pytest test (e.g., tests/test_random_word_file.py) asserts
          that RANDOM_WORD.txt exists at the repo root, is non-empty, and
          contains exactly one whitespace-delimited token. Keeps the file
          under CI coverage and catches accidental deletion or corruption.
        selected: true
      - option: 'No test'
        description: >
          Skip adding a test. The file is trivial and unlikely to break.
          Reduces test surface but leaves the file unguarded by CI.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      Adding a minimal test costs almost nothing and gives the file a CI
      safety net consistent with the project's pytest-based test suite.
      Other root-level content files lack tests only because no test
      infrastructure was in place when they were added; establishing the
      pattern now is a small improvement with no downside.
    answer: 'Add a test'

  - question: 'What should the exact file content look like — bare word, word with trailing newline, or word with surrounding whitespace?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Single word with trailing newline'
        description: >
          File contains exactly one lowercase English word followed by a
          single newline character (POSIX-compliant text file). E.g.,
          "serendipity\n". Clean, readable, git-friendly (no "No newline
          at end of file" warning).
        selected: true
      - option: 'Bare word, no newline'
        description: >
          File contains only the word bytes, no trailing newline. Slightly
          non-standard for a text file and will trigger a git warning.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      A trailing newline is the POSIX standard for text files and avoids
      git's "No newline at end of file" diff warning. Single lowercase word
      keeps the content minimal and easy to parse programmatically.
    answer: 'Single word with trailing newline'

  ## Problem Statement

  The repository currently contains several content files at the root (JOKE.md,
  JOKE2.md, JOKE3.md, SHEEP.md, DESIGN_PATTERN.md). This feature adds a plain
  text file with a single random word, demonstrating the simplest possible file
  addition pattern and exercising the full spec → implementation → test workflow
  for a minimal change.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] `RANDOM_WORD.txt` exists at the repository root
  - [ ] The file contains exactly one word (no whitespace, newlines within the
        word, or multiple tokens)
  - [ ] The file ends with a single trailing newline (POSIX-compliant)
  - [ ] The word is a real English word (not gibberish or a placeholder)
  - [ ] `pytest` passes with a test that asserts the above properties
  - [ ] CI (build + test) passes on the feature branch after the file is added

  ## Functional Requirements

  - **FR-1**: The repository root MUST contain a file named exactly `RANDOM_WORD.txt`.
  - **FR-2**: `RANDOM_WORD.txt` MUST contain exactly one word — a sequence of
    non-whitespace characters with no embedded spaces, tabs, or newlines.
  - **FR-3**: The file MUST be a valid POSIX text file: content ends with exactly
    one newline character (`\n`); no BOM or Windows-style line endings (`\r\n`).
  - **FR-4**: The word MUST be a recognisable English word (common noun, verb,
    adjective, or adverb) chosen by the implementer.
  - **FR-5**: A pytest test MUST be added at `tests/test_random_word_file.py`
    that asserts FR-1, FR-2, and FR-3 programmatically.

  ## Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR-1**: The file MUST be committed as a static asset — no runtime
    generation script is required to reproduce it.
  - **NFR-2**: Adding the file MUST NOT introduce any new Python package
    dependencies (no additions to `pyproject.toml` or `requirements*.txt`).
  - **NFR-3**: The test MUST complete in under 1 second (trivial file read).
  - **NFR-4**: The file MUST be tracked by git (not listed in `.gitignore`).
  - **NFR-5**: File encoding MUST be UTF-8.

  ## Product Questions & AI Recommendations

  | # | Question | AI Recommendation | Rationale |
  | - | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
  | 1 | How should the random word be sourced? | Hardcoded static word | Matches existing content-file pattern; zero dependencies; S-sized task |
  | 2 | Should a pytest test be added? | Add a test | Minimal cost, provides CI coverage, establishes good pattern |
  | 3 | What should the file content look like? | Single word + trailing newline | POSIX-compliant, git-friendly, easy to parse |

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | / (repo root) | Low | New RANDOM_WORD.txt file added here |
  | tests/ | Low | New test file tests/test_random_word_file.py asserts file validity |

  ## Dependencies

  No external dependencies. Uses only the existing file system and Python `pathlib`
  stdlib in the test.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Two files: `RANDOM_WORD.txt` (one line) and
  `tests/test_random_word_file.py` (< 20 lines). Total implementation time
  is under 15 minutes including CI verification.
