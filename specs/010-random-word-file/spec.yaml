oneLiner: Create a txt file containing a single random word
summary: >
  Add a RANDOM_WORD.txt file to the repository root containing a single random
  word. This is a minimal content addition following the same pattern as existing
  markdown files (JOKE.md, SHEEP.md) that live at the repo root.

  ## Problem Statement

  The repository currently contains several content files at the root (JOKE.md,
  JOKE2.md, JOKE3.md, SHEEP.md, DESIGN_PATTERN.md). This feature adds a plain
  text file with a single random word, demonstrating the simplest possible file
  addition pattern.

  ## Codebase Analysis

  ### Project Structure

  ```
  /
  ├── src/sheep/          # Core Python package (crewai-based agentic platform)
  │   ├── agents/         # CrewAI agent definitions
  │   ├── config/         # Settings and LLM configuration
  │   ├── flows/          # CrewAI flow definitions
  │   ├── observability/  # Langfuse + structlog
  │   └── tools/          # BaseTool implementations (file, git, web)
  ├── tests/              # pytest test suite
  ├── specs/              # Feature specifications (this directory)
  └── *.md / *.txt        # Root-level content files
  ```

  ### Architecture Patterns

  - Root-level content files (JOKE.md, SHEEP.md, etc.) are plain files committed
    directly to the repository — no code generation pipeline involved.
  - Tools layer (`src/sheep/tools/file_tools.py`) provides `FileWriteTool` used
    by agents, but a static file addition does not need to go through tooling.
  - Tests live in `tests/` and use pytest with no async requirements for simple
    unit tests.

  ### Relevant Technologies

  - No framework dependency needed — this is a static file.
  - Python `random` stdlib if a script is desired, but a hardcoded word in a
    committed file is the simplest approach consistent with existing content files.

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | / (repo root) | Low | New RANDOM_WORD.txt file added here |
  | tests/ | Low | Optional: add a trivial test asserting file exists and contains one word |

  ## Dependencies

  No external dependencies. Uses only the existing file system and Python stdlib
  if a generative script is added.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Single file addition. Creating `RANDOM_WORD.txt` at the repo root with
  one word is a minutes-long task. An optional test adds trivial overhead.
