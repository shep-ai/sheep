  ## Summary

  A single task creates JOKE.md in the repository root. The file gets an H1 heading
  and one pun or one-liner joke as a plain text paragraph. No TDD cycle since this is
  a static content file with no executable code. Verification is manual: confirm the
  file exists, has valid markdown structure, and meets the line count and encoding requirements.
