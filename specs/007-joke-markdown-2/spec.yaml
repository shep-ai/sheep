openQuestions:
  - question: 'What should the markdown file be named?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'JOKE.md'
        description: 'Simple, uppercase convention matching README.md. Immediately obvious what the file contains.'
        selected: true
      - option: 'joke.md'
        description: 'Lowercase filename. Less visually prominent in directory listings but follows common markdown naming.'
        selected: false
      - option: 'JOKES.md'
        description: 'Plural form, implies a collection. Could invite future additions but overpromises for a single joke.'
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: 'JOKE.md matches the uppercase convention of README.md already in the repo root, making it visually consistent and immediately discoverable.'
    answer: 'JOKE.md'

  - question: 'What type of joke should be included?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'A pun or one-liner'
        description: 'Short, self-contained, fits the "stupid joke" brief perfectly. Easy to read at a glance.'
        selected: true
      - option: 'A knock-knock joke'
        description: 'Classic format, inherently silly. Slightly longer but still short. Uses dialogue structure.'
        selected: false
      - option: 'A question-and-answer joke'
        description: 'Setup-punchline format (e.g., "Why did the chicken..."). Clean structure, universally understood.'
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: 'A pun or one-liner is the most concise format, keeping the file minimal and matching the "short, stupid joke" requirement.'
    answer: 'A pun or one-liner'

  - question: 'Should the file include a markdown heading or just the joke text?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Include an H1 heading'
        description: 'Adds a title like "# Joke" for proper markdown structure. Renders nicely on GitHub.'
        selected: true
      - option: 'Just the joke, no heading'
        description: 'Minimal content, no formatting beyond the joke itself. As simple as possible.'
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: 'An H1 heading gives the file proper markdown structure and renders cleanly when viewed on GitHub or any markdown viewer.'
    answer: 'Include an H1 heading'

  ## Problem Statement

  The repo needs a short markdown file with a stupid joke. No code changes, no dependencies, just a fun `.md` file added to the repository root.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] A file named `JOKE.md` exists in the repository root
  - [ ] The file contains valid markdown with an H1 heading
  - [ ] The file contains exactly one short, silly joke (pun or one-liner)
  - [ ] The file is under 10 lines long
  - [ ] No existing files are modified

  ## Functional Requirements

  - **FR-1**: Create a new file named `JOKE.md` in the repository root directory
  - **FR-2**: The file must contain a top-level markdown heading (H1)
  - **FR-3**: The file must contain one short, silly joke in plain text
  - **FR-4**: The file must be valid markdown that renders correctly on GitHub

  ## Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR-1**: The file must be concise — no more than 10 lines total
  - **NFR-2**: The joke must be clean and appropriate for a public repository
  - **NFR-3**: The file must use UTF-8 encoding and end with a newline

  ## Product Questions & AI Recommendations

  | # | Question | AI Recommendation | Rationale |
  | - | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
  | 1 | What should the markdown file be named? | JOKE.md | Matches uppercase convention of README.md, immediately discoverable |
  | 2 | What type of joke should be included? | A pun or one-liner | Most concise format, fits the "short, stupid joke" brief |
  | 3 | Should the file include a markdown heading? | Include an H1 heading | Proper markdown structure, renders cleanly on GitHub |

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | Repository root | Low | Adding one new `.md` file, no existing files modified |

  ## Dependencies

  None.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Single file creation, no logic, no tests needed, ~5 minutes of work.
