  pun/one-liner joke. No code changes, no dependencies, no modifications to existing files.
  Follows the uppercase naming convention established by README.md.

  ## Architecture Overview

  This is a standalone content file added to the repository root alongside README.md.
  It has no connections to existing code, no build integration, and no impact on
  the project's architecture. It follows the same uppercase naming convention as
  README.md already present in the root.

  ## Key Design Decisions

  1. **JOKE.md (uppercase)** — Matches README.md convention in the repo root for
     visual consistency in directory listings.

  2. **Single H1 heading + plain text paragraph** — Matches the pattern in README.md
     ("# Sheep") and provides proper markdown document structure for clean GitHub rendering.
     No blockquotes or code blocks since the content is prose.

  3. **Pun or one-liner format** — Most concise joke format, keeps the file well under
     the 10-line NFR limit.

  4. **Single trailing newline** — POSIX convention, avoids git diff warnings.

  ## Implementation Strategy

  Single phase: create the file with the correct content and verify it meets all
  acceptance criteria. No phasing needed for a one-file content addition.

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | File already exists | Check for existing JOKE.md before creating |
  | Invalid markdown | Verify H1 heading syntax and overall structure |
