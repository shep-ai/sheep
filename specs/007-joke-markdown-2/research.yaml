name: joke-markdown-2
summary: >
  Trivial content-only addition requiring a single JOKE.md file in the repository root.
  No code changes, dependencies, or architectural impact. The only decisions involve
  file naming conventions and markdown formatting to match existing repo patterns.

decisions:
  - title: 'File Naming Convention'
    chosen: 'JOKE.md (uppercase, matching README.md convention)'
    rejected:
      - 'joke.md — Lowercase would be inconsistent with the existing README.md in the repo root. All root-level documentation files in this repo use uppercase naming.'
      - 'JOKES.md — Plural form overpromises; the spec calls for exactly one joke. Would invite scope creep.'
    rationale: >
      The repository root already contains README.md using uppercase naming convention.
      JOKE.md maintains visual consistency in directory listings and follows the same
      pattern established by the project. This is immediately discoverable and clearly
      communicates the file's purpose.

  - title: 'Markdown Structure'
    chosen: 'Single H1 heading followed by the joke text'
    rejected:
      - 'No heading, just raw joke text — While maximally minimal, this produces poor rendering on GitHub and lacks proper markdown document structure. README.md in this repo uses headings consistently.'
      - 'H1 heading plus H2 subheading (e.g., "## Punchline") — Over-structured for a single one-liner joke. Adds unnecessary complexity for trivial content.'
    rationale: >
      A single H1 heading provides proper markdown document structure that renders
      cleanly on GitHub. This matches the pattern in README.md which starts with
      "# Sheep". The heading gives context when the file is viewed in any markdown
      renderer, while keeping the file concise (under 10 lines as required by NFR-1).

  - title: 'Joke Format'
    chosen: 'Pun or one-liner as plain text paragraph'
    rejected:
      - 'Blockquote formatting (> joke text) — Adds unnecessary markdown syntax for a single joke. Blockquotes imply attribution which is not needed here.'
      - 'Joke in a code block — Code blocks are semantically wrong for prose content. Would look odd and misrepresent the content type.'
    rationale: >
      A plain text paragraph after the H1 heading is the simplest valid markdown
      structure. It renders identically across all markdown viewers, requires no
      special formatting knowledge to read in raw form, and keeps the file under
      the 10-line limit. This matches how README.md presents its introductory text.

openQuestions:
  - question: 'Should the file end with exactly one trailing newline?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Yes, single trailing newline'
        description: 'POSIX standard for text files. Most editors and git are configured to expect this. Avoids "No newline at end of file" warnings in diffs.'
        selected: true
      - option: 'No trailing newline'
        description: 'Slightly smaller file but triggers warnings in git diff and many linters. Considered bad practice in virtually all codebases.'
        selected: false
      - option: 'Multiple trailing newlines'
        description: 'No benefit over single newline. Adds unnecessary whitespace and may trigger linter warnings.'
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      POSIX convention and git best practice require text files to end with a single
      newline character. This avoids the "No newline at end of file" warning in git
      diffs and is consistent with how all other files in the repository are formatted.
    answer: 'Yes, single trailing newline'

  ## Status

  - **Phase:** Research (Complete)
  - **Updated:** 2026-02-23

  ## Technology Decisions

  ### 1. File Naming Convention

  **Chosen:** JOKE.md (uppercase, matching README.md convention)

  **Rejected:**
  - joke.md — Inconsistent with existing README.md uppercase convention in repo root
  - JOKES.md — Plural form overpromises for a single joke; invites scope creep

  **Rationale:** The repo root contains README.md using uppercase naming. JOKE.md maintains visual consistency and is immediately discoverable.

  ### 2. Markdown Structure

  **Chosen:** Single H1 heading followed by the joke text

  **Rejected:**
  - No heading, raw text only — Poor GitHub rendering, lacks proper document structure
  - H1 + H2 subheading — Over-structured for a one-liner joke

  **Rationale:** A single H1 heading matches the pattern in README.md ("# Sheep") and provides proper markdown document structure for clean GitHub rendering.

  ### 3. Joke Format

  **Chosen:** Pun or one-liner as plain text paragraph

  **Rejected:**
  - Blockquote formatting — Unnecessary syntax, implies attribution
  - Code block — Semantically wrong for prose content

  **Rationale:** Plain text paragraph is the simplest valid markdown, renders identically everywhere, and keeps the file well under the 10-line limit.

  ## Library Analysis

  | Library | Purpose | Decision | Reasoning |
  | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
  | N/A | N/A | N/A | No libraries needed — this is a static markdown file with no code |

  ## Security Considerations

  No security implications. This is a static content file with no executable code, no user input handling, no data processing, and no external dependencies. The joke content should be clean and appropriate for a public repository (NFR-2).

  ## Performance Implications

  No performance implications. A single small markdown file (~100 bytes) has zero impact on build times, CI pipelines, or repository operations.

  ## Architecture Notes

  This change has no architectural impact. It adds a single standalone file to the repository root with no connections to existing code, no imports, no configuration changes, and no modifications to any existing files. The file sits alongside README.md as a root-level documentation file.

  ## Implementation Notes

  The implementation is straightforward:
  1. Create JOKE.md in the repository root
  2. Add an H1 heading (e.g., "# Joke")
  3. Add one pun or one-liner joke as a plain text paragraph
  4. Ensure the file ends with a single newline
  5. Verify the file is valid markdown and under 10 lines
