oneLiner: Add a random plain-text (.txt) file to the repository root
summary: >
  Extend the repository's collection of content files by adding a single plain-text (.txt)
  file at the repository root. The file follows the same UPPER_SNAKE_CASE naming convention
  as existing content files (JOKE.md, SHEEP.md, DESIGN_PATTERN.md) but uses the .txt
  extension rather than .md. Content topic is "random" — no prescribed subject matter.
  This is a content-only task — no source code, tests, or configuration files are modified.

openQuestions:
  - question: 'What should the filename of the new .txt file be?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'RANDOM.txt'
        description: >
          Simple, direct name that signals the file is intentionally random/miscellaneous.
          Consistent with the short, descriptive UPPER_SNAKE_CASE names used by JOKE.md and SHEEP.md.
          Easy to discover and understand at a glance.
        selected: true
      - option: 'RANDOM_FACT.txt'
        description: >
          More specific name that implies the content will be a fact or piece of trivia.
          Constrains the content author slightly more than a bare RANDOM.txt would.
        selected: false
      - option: 'NOTES.txt'
        description: >
          Generic utility name. Does not convey the "random" framing of the feature and
          could be confused with a developer scratch file rather than an intentional content file.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      RANDOM.txt is recommended because it directly reflects the feature's "random" framing,
      is maximally short and memorable, and follows the same brevity convention as JOKE.md
      and SHEEP.md. It imposes no constraints on content topic while still being self-documenting.
    answer: 'RANDOM.txt'

  - question: 'What content topic should the .txt file contain?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Fun fact or trivia'
        description: >
          A short, interesting fact (science, history, nature, etc.). Easy to write,
          always appropriate, and aligns with the "random" spirit of the feature. No
          formatting required — plain prose works perfectly in .txt.
        selected: true
      - option: 'ASCII art'
        description: >
          A small ASCII art image. Visually distinctive and fun, but may not be
          meaningful as "content" in the same way the other files are (jokes, sheep story,
          design patterns). Also harder to author well in plain text.
        selected: false
      - option: 'Motivational quote'
        description: >
          A short inspirational or humorous quote. Simple to write but may feel
          generic compared to the more original content in existing files.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      A fun fact or trivia item best fits the "random" theme: it is brief, self-contained,
      requires no formatting, and is analogous in spirit to the existing jokes and sheep story.
      Plain prose facts are the most natural content for a .txt file.
    answer: 'Fun fact or trivia'

  - question: 'Should the .txt file include a title or header line?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'No header — body text only'
        description: >
          Pure content, no title line. Maximally minimal. Plain .txt files have no
          formatting convention mandating a header; omitting one keeps the file clean.
        selected: true
      - option: 'Simple plain-text header (e.g., all-caps title line)'
        description: >
          A single all-caps title line followed by the content, mirroring how some
          plain-text documents are structured. Adds marginal discoverability but also
          adds noise to a short file.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      No header is recommended. The file will be short (a few sentences at most) and
      its name already describes it. Adding a header line to a tiny content file
      would be over-engineering. All other content files use Markdown headers — a .txt
      header would be a weak imitation rather than a natural convention.
    answer: 'No header — body text only'

  - question: 'What is the minimum acceptable content length for the .txt file?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'One sentence (≥ 1 complete sentence)'
        description: >
          The absolute minimum that constitutes meaningful content. A single complete
          sentence is sufficient to satisfy the "random content file" requirement and
          is consistent with how short some of the joke files are.
        selected: true
      - option: 'Short paragraph (3–5 sentences)'
        description: >
          More substantial content. Provides a richer reading experience but is beyond
          the minimal scope of a "random" content file. Could be appropriate if the
          author wants to tell a brief story or give context.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      One complete sentence is the recommended minimum. This mirrors the minimalist,
      S-sized scope of the task. Content quality matters more than quantity; a single
      well-chosen fact is better than padding to meet an arbitrary sentence count.
    answer: 'One sentence (≥ 1 complete sentence)'

  ## Problem Statement

  The repository contains several content files at its root (JOKE.md, JOKE2.md, JOKE3.md,
  SHEEP.md, DESIGN_PATTERN.md, DESIGN_PATTERN_SUMMARY.md), all in Markdown format.
  This feature adds a plain-text (.txt) file — the first non-Markdown content file —
  to that collection. The file's content is intentionally "random" (no prescribed topic),
  making this a minimal, low-risk content addition.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] A file named `RANDOM.txt` exists at the repository root
  - [ ] The file is UTF-8 encoded with no binary content
  - [ ] The file contains at least one complete, grammatically correct sentence
  - [ ] The filename follows UPPER_SNAKE_CASE convention (matches pattern `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*\.txt`)
  - [ ] No existing files are modified
  - [ ] No source code, test, or CI configuration files are added or changed
  - [ ] The file is tracked by Git (present in `git ls-files` output)
  - [ ] CI passes (pytest suite remains green; .txt file has no impact)

  ## Functional Requirements

  - **FR-1**: A new file `RANDOM.txt` MUST be created at the repository root (`/`).
  - **FR-2**: The file MUST contain readable plain-text content in English (at minimum one complete sentence).
  - **FR-3**: The file MUST be encoded in UTF-8.
  - **FR-4**: The file MUST end with a single newline character (Unix line endings, LF).
  - **FR-5**: The file content MUST be original — not copied verbatim from existing repo content files.
  - **FR-6**: No existing files in the repository MUST be modified as part of this feature.

  ## Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR-1**: **Naming convention** — The filename MUST follow the existing UPPER_SNAKE_CASE convention used by all other root-level content files.
  - **NFR-2**: **Minimal footprint** — The change set MUST consist of exactly one new file; no other additions or deletions are permitted.
  - **NFR-3**: **CI compatibility** — The addition MUST NOT break any existing automated checks (pytest suite, linting, or CI workflow).
  - **NFR-4**: **Content appropriateness** — Content MUST be suitable for a professional open-source repository (no offensive, sensitive, or proprietary material).
  - **NFR-5**: **File size** — The file SHOULD be small (under 4 KB); this is a brief content snippet, not a document.

  ## Product Questions & AI Recommendations

  | # | Question | AI Recommendation | Rationale |
  | - | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
  | 1 | What should the filename be? | `RANDOM.txt` | Short, descriptive, consistent with UPPER_SNAKE_CASE convention; directly reflects the "random" framing |
  | 2 | What content topic? | Fun fact or trivia | Brief, original, self-contained; natural fit for a plain .txt file |
  | 3 | Should there be a title/header line? | No header — body text only | File is too short to warrant a header; name already describes it |
  | 4 | Minimum content length? | One sentence (≥ 1 complete sentence) | Matches the S-sized, minimalist scope; quality over quantity |

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | repo root (new file) | Low | Adding one new .txt file; no existing files modified |
  | specs/010-random-txt-file/ | Low | Spec YAML updated as part of the requirements phase |

  ## Dependencies

  None. This is a standalone content file. No Python source, no tests, no CI configuration
  changes are required. The only constraint is following the existing UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  naming convention for repo-root content files.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Single plain-text file creation with no code, no tests, and no integration work.
  Identical scope to specs 006–009 (all rated S). Requirements analysis confirms no hidden
  complexity; the four open questions are all resolved with straightforward defaults.
