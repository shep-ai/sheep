oneLiner: Add a random plain-text (.txt) file to the repository root
summary: >
  Extend the repository's collection of content files by adding a single plain-text (.txt)
  file at the repository root. The file follows the same UPPER_SNAKE_CASE naming convention
  as existing content files (JOKE.md, SHEEP.md, DESIGN_PATTERN.md) but uses the .txt
  extension rather than .md. This is a content-only task — no source code, tests, or
  configuration files are modified.

  ## Problem Statement

  The repository contains several content files at its root (JOKE.md, JOKE2.md, JOKE3.md,
  SHEEP.md, DESIGN_PATTERN.md, DESIGN_PATTERN_SUMMARY.md), all in Markdown format.
  This feature adds a plain-text (.txt) file — the first non-Markdown content file —
  to that collection. The file's content is intentionally "random" (no prescribed topic),
  making this a minimal, low-risk content addition.

  ## Codebase Analysis

  ### Architecture Patterns

  - **Content files at repo root**: All non-source content follows UPPER_SNAKE_CASE naming
    (e.g., JOKE.md, SHEEP.md). This convention is consistent across all prior content specs
    (006 through 009).
  - **Markdown-first**: All existing content files use .md. This feature introduces the
    first .txt file, which is still consistent with the "random content" framing.
  - **No coupling to source**: Content files are standalone; they have no imports, no
    references in Python source, and do not affect tests or CI.
  - **CI**: The workflow runs `pytest` against `tests/`. A plain .txt file has no impact
    on the test suite or build process.

  ### Relevant Technologies

  - **Plain text / UTF-8**: The output is a .txt file with no special formatting requirements.
  - **Git**: The file will be tracked in the repository like all other content files.
  - **pytest** (existing): No changes required; tests are unaffected.

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | repo root (new file) | Low | Adding one new .txt file; no existing files modified |
  | specs/010-random-txt-file/ | Low | Spec YAML updated as part of the analysis phase |

  ## Dependencies

  None. This is a standalone content file. No Python source, no tests, no CI configuration
  changes are required. The only constraint is following the existing UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  naming convention for repo-root content files.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Single plain-text file creation with no code, no tests, and no integration work.
  Identical scope to specs 006–009 (all rated S). Content authoring only.
