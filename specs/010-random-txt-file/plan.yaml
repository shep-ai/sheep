  Create a single plain-text file (RANDOM.txt) at the repository root containing a fun fact.
  UTF-8 encoded, LF line endings, no header, one complete sentence minimum. No code, tests,
  or CI changes required — purely a content addition following the existing UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  repo-root convention.

  ## Architecture Overview

  The repository root serves as a flat collection of content artefacts with UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  filenames (JOKE.md, JOKE2.md, JOKE3.md, SHEEP.md, DESIGN_PATTERN.md,
  DESIGN_PATTERN_SUMMARY.md). RANDOM.txt extends this collection as the first non-Markdown
  content file. The convention is filename-based, not extension-based, so .txt fits naturally
  without any structural changes to the repository.

  No application code, configuration, or documentation enumerates or references root-level
  content files. Adding RANDOM.txt is entirely additive and inert with respect to all
  automated checks.

  ## Key Design Decisions

  ### 1. File Encoding and Line Endings
  **Chosen:** UTF-8, Unix LF line endings, single trailing newline.
  All existing root-level content files (JOKE.md, SHEEP.md, DESIGN_PATTERN.md) use UTF-8 + LF
  with a single trailing newline. There is no .gitattributes or .editorconfig enforcing a
  different policy, so mirroring the existing convention is the only correct choice.

  ### 2. Content Format
  **Chosen:** Plain prose fun fact, no header, no markup.
  The spec explicitly resolves against a header (file too short; name already describes it).
  One complete sentence is the minimum — padding adds no value for an S-sized task.
  Plain prose is the most natural format for a .txt file.

  ### 3. CI and Tooling Impact
  **Chosen:** No CI or tooling changes.
  The CI workflow runs only `sleep 10` steps. No linting, pytest, or content validation
  exists. RANDOM.txt is completely inert with respect to all automated checks.

  ### 4. Git Tracking
  **Chosen:** Standard `git add RANDOM.txt`.
  Identical to how all existing content files are tracked. No special handling required.

  ## Implementation Strategy

  Single phase, single task: author RANDOM.txt and commit it. The entire change set is
  exactly one new file. No dependencies, no sequencing concerns, no integration work.

  The TDD cycle for a content-only file is degenerate: there is no production code to test.
  The "test" is a manual or scripted verification of the success criteria (file exists,
  UTF-8, LF endings, ≥1 sentence, git-tracked).

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | CRLF line endings introduced by editor | Verify with `file RANDOM.txt` or `cat -A RANDOM.txt`; author with LF-default editor setting |
  | Missing trailing newline | Check with `xxd RANDOM.txt \| tail -1`; ensure file ends with 0x0a |
  | Content inappropriate for open-source repo | Choose a well-known, neutral scientific fact; review before committing |
  | Accidentally modifying an existing file | Review `git diff` before staging; only `git add RANDOM.txt` |
