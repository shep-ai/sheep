    description: >
      Author a plain-text file named RANDOM.txt at the repository root. The file must
      contain at least one complete, grammatically correct English sentence with a fun fact
      or trivia item. No header line. UTF-8 encoded, Unix LF line endings, single trailing
      newline. Stage and verify with git.

  ## Summary

  This feature is a single-task content addition. The only work is authoring RANDOM.txt
  with a fun fact, verifying it meets the file conventions (UTF-8, LF, trailing newline,
  no header, ≥1 sentence), and staging it with git. There are no code changes, no tests
  to write, and no dependencies to resolve. The TDD cycle is not applicable to a pure
  content file — verification is done by inspecting the file and git status directly.
