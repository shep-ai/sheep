# Research Artifact (YAML)
# This is the source of truth. Markdown is auto-generated from this file.

name: random-txt-file
summary: >
  This is a pure content-addition task: create a single plain-text file (RANDOM.txt) at the
  repository root. All existing content files are UTF-8 with LF line endings; RANDOM.txt must
  match those conventions. No libraries, no code, no CI changes are required — the CI pipeline
  runs only `sleep 10` and is unaffected by any .txt file addition.

# Structured technology decisions
decisions:
  - title: 'File Encoding and Line Endings'
    chosen: 'UTF-8 encoding, Unix LF line endings, single trailing newline'
    rejected:
      - 'UTF-16 — unnecessary complexity; all existing repo files use UTF-8; no tooling requires it'
      - 'CRLF line endings — no Windows-specific tooling in this repo; all existing content files
        (JOKE.md, SHEEP.md, DESIGN_PATTERN.md) use LF; CRLF would be inconsistent and can cause
        git diff noise without a .gitattributes safeguard'
    rationale: >
      Inspection of all existing root-level content files confirms UTF-8 + LF is the universal
      convention. JOKE.md (311 bytes), SHEEP.md (764 bytes), and DESIGN_PATTERN.md (9263 bytes)
      all end with a single LF and contain no CRLF sequences. There is no .gitattributes or
      .editorconfig in the repository enforcing a different policy, so the safest choice is to
      mirror what already exists. A single trailing newline (not blank lines) is the POSIX
      convention for text files and matches the existing files.

  - title: 'Content Authoring Approach'
    chosen: 'Inline plain prose — a single self-contained fun fact, no header, no markup'
    rejected:
      - 'Markdown-style header line (e.g., "RANDOM FACT") — the spec explicitly resolves against
        any header; the file is too short to warrant one, and an all-caps header in a .txt file
        would mimic Markdown conventions weakly rather than following them properly'
      - 'Multi-sentence paragraph — the spec resolves minimum length as one complete sentence;
        padding to multiple sentences adds no value for an S-sized content task'
    rationale: >
      The spec resolves all four open questions unambiguously: filename = RANDOM.txt, content =
      fun fact or trivia, no header, minimum one sentence. Plain prose with no markup is the most
      natural format for a .txt file. Existing content files (JOKE.md, SHEEP.md) demonstrate that
      short, self-contained content is preferred in this repo. A single interesting fact satisfies
      FR-2 (readable English content), FR-5 (original content), and NFR-4 (appropriate for a
      professional open-source repository).

  - title: 'CI and Tooling Impact Assessment'
    chosen: 'No CI or tooling changes needed; .txt file has zero impact on existing checks'
    rejected:
      - 'Adding a spell-check or content-lint step — out of scope for an S-sized task; no existing
        content files are linted; introducing new CI steps would violate NFR-2 (minimal footprint)
        and FR-6 (no existing files modified)'
      - 'Adding a .gitattributes rule for *.txt line endings — unnecessary because the file will be
        authored with LF line endings directly; adding .gitattributes would modify an existing
        (or create a new) config file, violating NFR-2'
    rationale: >
      The CI workflow (ci.yml) contains only `sleep 10` steps for Build and Test jobs — no linting,
      no content validation, no file-pattern checks. A new .txt file cannot trigger any existing
      automated failure. pytest is not invoked anywhere in CI, and there are no Python source files
      that reference root-level content files. The addition of RANDOM.txt is therefore completely
      inert with respect to all automated checks.

  - title: 'Git Tracking Strategy'
    chosen: 'Standard `git add RANDOM.txt` — no special handling required'
    rejected:
      - 'Adding RANDOM.txt to a .gitignore exclusion list — contradicts the success criterion
        requiring presence in `git ls-files` output'
      - 'Using git LFS for the file — LFS is for large binaries; a sub-4 KB text file has no
        business in LFS and the repo shows no evidence of LFS usage'
    rationale: >
      All existing root-level content files (JOKE.md, SHEEP.md, etc.) are tracked as ordinary
      Git-managed text files. RANDOM.txt is identical in nature — a small UTF-8 text file under
      4 KB. Standard `git add` is the correct and only necessary action. No .gitignore patterns
      in the repository would inadvertently exclude a .txt file at the root.

  ## Technology Decisions

  ### 1. File Encoding and Line Endings

  **Chosen:** UTF-8 encoding, Unix LF line endings, single trailing newline

  **Rejected:**
  - UTF-16 — unnecessary; all existing repo files use UTF-8
  - CRLF line endings — inconsistent with JOKE.md, SHEEP.md, DESIGN_PATTERN.md (all LF); no
    .gitattributes safeguard exists to normalise them

  **Rationale:** Direct inspection of existing content files confirms UTF-8 + LF is universal
  in this repository. Mirroring that convention is the only correct choice.

  ### 2. Content Authoring Approach

  **Chosen:** Single self-contained fun fact, plain prose, no header, no markup

  **Rejected:**
  - Markdown-style header line — spec explicitly resolves against headers; file too short to
    warrant one
  - Multi-sentence paragraph — spec minimum is one complete sentence; padding adds no value

  **Rationale:** Spec open questions are all resolved. Plain prose with no markup is natural for
  .txt. One well-chosen fact satisfies all functional requirements.

  ### 3. CI and Tooling Impact

  **Chosen:** No changes to CI or tooling

  **Rejected:**
  - Spell-check / content-lint CI step — out of scope; violates NFR-2 (minimal footprint)
  - .gitattributes *.txt rule — unnecessary given file will be authored with LF; would modify
    a config file, violating NFR-2

  **Rationale:** CI runs only `sleep 10`. No linting, no pytest, no content checks. The .txt
  file is completely inert with respect to all automated checks.

  ### 4. Git Tracking Strategy

  **Chosen:** Standard `git add RANDOM.txt`

  **Rejected:**
  - .gitignore exclusion — contradicts the success criterion requiring `git ls-files` presence
  - Git LFS — inappropriate for a sub-4 KB text file; no LFS usage elsewhere in the repo

  **Rationale:** All existing content files are ordinary tracked text files. RANDOM.txt is
  identical in nature and requires no special handling.

  ## Library Analysis

  | Library | Purpose | Decision | Reasoning |
  | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
  | None    | N/A     | N/A      | Content-only task; no libraries, frameworks, or dependencies involved |

  ## Security Considerations

  - **Content appropriateness**: The chosen content (a fun fact) must satisfy NFR-4 — suitable
    for a professional open-source repository. No sensitive, offensive, or proprietary material.
  - **No executable content**: A plain .txt file cannot contain executable code or scripts.
    There is no injection risk from a static text file committed to a repository.
  - **No secrets**: The file must not contain API keys, credentials, or any sensitive data.
    A trivia fact poses zero risk.

  ## Performance Implications

  None. A single static text file under 4 KB has no measurable impact on:
  - Repository clone time (negligible size addition)
  - CI pipeline duration (CI does not read or process content files)
  - Any runtime system (no application code references root-level content files)

  ## Architecture Notes

  This feature adds the repository's first non-Markdown content file. The existing pattern
  (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE filenames at the repo root) extends naturally to .txt — the convention
  is filename-based, not extension-based. No existing code, configuration, or documentation
  enumerates root-level content files or would need updating to accommodate a new .txt file.
  The repo root serves as a simple flat collection of content artefacts; RANDOM.txt fits
  that model without any structural changes.
