summary: >
  Pure content change: append one new one-liner joke to JOKE.md following the
  established pattern (--- separator, one-liner style matching the most recent
  entry). No code, no tests, no architectural decisions beyond format matching.

      Append a new one-liner joke to JOKE.md with a --- separator, matching the
      format established by features 006 and 007. This is the only phase — the
      entire feature is a single file edit with no code or configuration changes.

  ## Architecture Overview

  JOKE.md lives at the repository root and is purely human-readable content.
  It is not imported, parsed, or referenced by any source code. The file
  currently contains two jokes separated by a horizontal rule (---):

  1. Q&A format: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode?" (feature 006)
  2. One-liner: "anti-gravity book" (feature 007)

  This feature appends a third joke using the same --- separator pattern.

  ## Key Design Decisions

  ### Joke Format: One-liner
  Chosen over Q&A format because the most recent joke (feature 007) is a
  one-liner, making it the freshest precedent. A one-liner requires no bold
  markup, trivially satisfies the 4-line limit (FR-3), and keeps the file
  visually light. The mandatory --- separator (FR-2) applies regardless.

  ### Joke Content: Original pun not in the file
  FR-4 explicitly prohibits duplicating either existing joke. A short,
  groan-worthy pun unrelated to dark mode or anti-gravity satisfies all
  requirements. Candidate: "I told my wife she was drawing her eyebrows too high.
  She looked surprised." — original, one-liner, groan-worthy, unrelated to
  existing jokes.

  The exact joke content is a creative choice; any original one-liner
  satisfying FR-3 through FR-5 is acceptable.

  ## Implementation Strategy

  Single-phase: open JOKE.md, append a blank line, ---, blank line, and the
  new one-liner joke, then verify no CRLF or trailing whitespace is introduced
  (NFR-2, NFR-3). The entire change is one task with no dependencies.

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | Accidentally duplicating an existing joke | Read current JOKE.md content before editing |
  | Introducing CRLF line endings | Use Edit tool which preserves LF |
  | Trailing whitespace on new lines | Keep joke text tight; no padding |
  | Breaking Markdown rendering | Use standard --- horizontal rule with surrounding blank lines |
