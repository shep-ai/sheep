    title: 'Append third joke to JOKE.md'
    description: >
      Edit JOKE.md to append a blank line, a --- horizontal rule, a blank line,
      and a new short one-liner joke. The joke must be original (not a duplicate
      of the two already present), short (≤4 lines), and groan-worthy.

  ## Summary

  A single task covers the entire feature: append a new one-liner joke to
  JOKE.md with the standard --- separator. There are no code dependencies,
  no setup steps, and no teardown. The task is self-contained and can be
  completed in a single file edit. TDD does not apply — this is a pure
  content change with no executable logic to test.
