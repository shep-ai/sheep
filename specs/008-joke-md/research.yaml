summary: >
  This feature is a pure content change: append one new joke to JOKE.md.
  No libraries, no code, no architecture decisions beyond matching the
  existing file format. The only meaningful choice is joke format (Q&A vs
  one-liner), where the one-liner style matches the most recent addition
  in the file and requires no extra formatting markup.

decisions:
  - title: 'Joke Format — Q&A vs One-liner'
    chosen: 'One-liner (plain prose joke)'
    rejected:
      - 'Q&A format (**Q:** / **A:**) — valid but requires more markup; the most recent joke in the file (anti-gravity) is a one-liner, making that the freshest precedent to follow'
      - 'Multi-line narrative joke — exceeds the 4-line limit in FR-3 and is inconsistent with the "short and stupid" brief'
    rationale: >
      JOKE.md already contains both styles. The anti-gravity one-liner was added
      second (feature 007) and represents the most recent convention. A one-liner
      requires zero extra markup, satisfies the 4-line limit trivially, and keeps
      the file simple. The --- separator is mandatory per FR-2 regardless of which
      style is chosen.

  - title: 'Joke Content Selection'
    chosen: 'A short pun or groan-worthy one-liner that is not about dark mode or anti-gravity'
    rejected:
      - 'Repeat of "Why do programmers prefer dark mode?" — explicitly excluded by FR-4'
      - 'Repeat of anti-gravity book joke — explicitly excluded by FR-4'
    rationale: >
      FR-4 prohibits duplicating either existing joke. A classic short pun
      (e.g. time-traveller restaurant joke) is original, groan-worthy, and
      fits within 4 lines. No code or logic is involved — content choice is
      the only creative decision.

  ## Technology Decisions

  ### 1. Joke Format — Q&A vs One-liner

  **Chosen:** One-liner (plain prose joke)

  **Rejected:**
  - Q&A format — valid but heavier markup; one-liner is the most recent precedent in the file
  - Multi-line narrative — violates the 4-line limit (FR-3) and the "short and stupid" brief

  **Rationale:** The anti-gravity one-liner (added in feature 007) is the most
  recent entry in JOKE.md and sets the freshest precedent. A one-liner is also the
  minimal viable format: no bold markers needed, trivially satisfies FR-3, and keeps
  the file visually light. The mandatory `---` separator (FR-2) applies either way.

  ### 2. Joke Content Selection

  **Chosen:** Original short pun not present in the file

  **Rejected:**
  - Any variant of the dark-mode bug joke (FR-4 explicit exclusion)
  - Any variant of the anti-gravity book joke (FR-4 explicit exclusion)

  **Rationale:** FR-4 is unambiguous. The chosen joke must be independently
  groan-worthy, short, and unrelated to the two existing punchlines.

  ## Library Analysis

  | Library | Purpose | Decision | Reasoning |
  | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
  | (none)  | N/A     | N/A      | Pure content change; no tooling required |

  ## Security Considerations

  No security implications. The change is a static Markdown file with no
  executable code, user input, or external data. The only concern is
  ensuring no accidental trailing whitespace or Windows line endings (CRLF)
  are introduced, per NFR-2 and NFR-3 — both easily verified with a diff.

  ## Performance Implications

  None. Adding a few lines to a small static file has no measurable impact
  on any system metric.

  ## Architecture Notes

  JOKE.md lives at the repository root alongside README.md. It is not
  imported, parsed, or referenced by any source code — it is purely
  human-readable content. Appending to it is fully self-contained and
  affects no other file or system component.
