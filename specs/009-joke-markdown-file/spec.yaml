oneLiner: Add a new markdown file containing a short stupid joke
userQuery: >
  create simple short md file with stupid joke, fast, no research, no thinking!
summary: >
  Add a new markdown joke file (e.g. JOKE3.md) following the existing pattern of
  JOKE.md and JOKE2.md. The file contains a single short, stupid joke in markdown
  format. No source code changes required — purely a content addition.

  ## Problem Statement

  The repository already has JOKE.md and JOKE2.md with short programmer jokes.
  The request is to add another markdown file with a stupid joke, quickly and
  without overthinking it.

  ## Codebase Analysis

  ### Project Structure

  ```
  /
  ├── JOKE.md          # First joke file (Q&A format + one-liners)
  ├── JOKE2.md         # Second joke file (Q&A format)
  ├── SHEEP.md         # Story content file
  ├── DESIGN_PATTERN.md
  ├── README.md
  ├── src/sheep/       # Python source package
  ├── tests/           # Python tests
  └── specs/           # Feature specs (this file)
  ```

  The repo is a Python project that also accumulates markdown joke/story content
  files at the repository root.

  ### Architecture Patterns

  Content markdown files live at the repo root. Each joke file is standalone,
  named `JOKE.md`, `JOKE2.md`, etc. They use a simple Q&A markdown format with
  bold **Q:** / **A:** headings and horizontal rules as separators.

  ### Relevant Technologies

  - Markdown — the only technology involved; no build tools, no tests, no code.

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | `/JOKE3.md` (new file) | Low | New standalone content file; no existing code touched |

  ## Dependencies

  None. This feature depends on nothing and nothing depends on it.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Single new markdown file, a few lines. Smallest possible unit of work.
