oneLiner: Add a new markdown file containing a short stupid joke
userQuery: >
  create simple short md file with stupid joke, fast, no research, no thinking!
summary: >
  Add a new markdown joke file (JOKE3.md) following the existing pattern of
  JOKE.md and JOKE2.md. The file contains at least one short, stupid joke in
  markdown format using bold Q:/A: headings. No source code changes required —
  purely a content addition.

    options:
      - option: 'JOKE3.md'
        description: >
          Follows the sequential naming convention established by JOKE.md and
          JOKE2.md. Predictable, consistent, and immediately obvious to readers
          browsing the repo root.
        selected: true
      - option: 'JOKES3.md or other variant'
        description: >
          A slight deviation from the existing pattern. Adds no value and breaks
          the naming sequence — avoid unless there is a specific reason.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      JOKE3.md is the obvious next entry in the sequence. Deviating from the
      established pattern for a trivial content file would be needlessly
      inconsistent.
    answer: 'JOKE3.md'

  - question: 'What joke format should be used?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Q&A format (bold Q:/A:)'
        description: >
          Matches the exact format used in JOKE.md and JOKE2.md: bold **Q:**
          and **A:** labels with horizontal rule separators. Maximally
          consistent with existing files.
        selected: true
      - option: 'Free-form prose or one-liner'
        description: >
          A single-line joke with no Q:/A: structure. Simpler but deviates
          from the established pattern; JOKE.md does include some one-liners
          as a secondary section, so it is not unprecedented.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      The Q&A format with bold labels is the dominant pattern in both existing
      joke files and should be the default for a new file. One-liners are an
      acceptable secondary addition but the primary joke should follow Q&A.
    answer: 'Q&A format (bold Q:/A:)'

  - question: 'How many jokes should JOKE3.md contain?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'One joke'
        description: >
          A single Q&A joke keeps the file minimal and consistent with the
          user's explicit request for something "fast" and "stupid". No padding
          required.
        selected: true
      - option: 'Two or more jokes'
        description: >
          Multiple jokes mirrors the style of JOKE.md (which has several).
          Adds more content but increases scope beyond what was requested.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      The user explicitly asked for a "simple short" file created "fast, no
      research, no thinking". One joke is the minimal viable deliverable that
      satisfies the request without over-engineering.
    answer: 'One joke'

  ## Problem Statement

  The repository already has JOKE.md and JOKE2.md with short programmer jokes.
  The request is to add another markdown file with a stupid joke, quickly and
  without overthinking it.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] A file named `JOKE3.md` exists at the repository root
  - [ ] The file is valid Markdown (renders without errors)
  - [ ] The file contains at least one joke in **Q:** / **A:** format
  - [ ] The joke is short (fits on a screen without scrolling)
  - [ ] No existing files are modified
  - [ ] No source code is added or changed

  ## Functional Requirements

  - **FR-1**: A new file `JOKE3.md` must be created at the repository root (`/JOKE3.md`).
  - **FR-2**: The file must contain at least one joke presented in bold Q:/A: question-and-answer format, consistent with `JOKE.md` and `JOKE2.md`.
  - **FR-3**: The joke must be a short, self-contained "stupid" (groan-worthy or pun-based) joke — not a long story or complex riddle.
  - **FR-4**: The file must use standard Markdown syntax (headings, bold, horizontal rules) as demonstrated in the existing joke files.
  - **FR-5**: No other files in the repository may be modified as part of this feature.

  ## Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR-1**: The file must be UTF-8 encoded with Unix line endings (LF), consistent with the rest of the repository.
  - **NFR-2**: The joke content must be inoffensive — no racial, gender, or other discriminatory humor; keep it purely pun/programmer/absurdist.
  - **NFR-3**: The file size must be trivial (< 1 KB); this is not a place for large content blocks.
  - **NFR-4**: The Markdown must render correctly on GitHub (standard GitHub Flavored Markdown).

  ## Product Questions & AI Recommendations

  | # | Question | AI Recommendation | Rationale |
  | - | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
  | 1 | What filename should the new joke file use? | JOKE3.md | Follows existing sequential naming convention |
  | 2 | What joke format should be used? | Q&A format (bold Q:/A:) | Matches dominant pattern in JOKE.md and JOKE2.md |
  | 3 | How many jokes should JOKE3.md contain? | One joke | User asked for simple/fast; one joke is minimal viable |

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | `/JOKE3.md` (new file) | Low | New standalone content file; no existing code touched |

  ## Dependencies

  None. This feature depends on nothing and nothing depends on it.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Single new markdown file containing one joke, ~10 lines. Smallest
  possible unit of work. Requirements analysis confirms no scope expansion.
