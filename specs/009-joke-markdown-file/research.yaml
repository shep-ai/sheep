# This is the source of truth. Markdown is auto-generated from this file.

name: joke-markdown-file
summary: >
  This feature requires creating a single new Markdown file (JOKE3.md) at the
  repository root. No libraries, frameworks, or source code changes are involved.
  All decisions reduce to content format and file conventions, both of which are
  fully dictated by the existing JOKE.md and JOKE2.md files.

# Structured technology decisions
decisions:
  - title: 'File Location and Naming'
    chosen: '/JOKE3.md at the repository root'
    rejected:
      - 'jokes/JOKE3.md in a subdirectory — no jokes/ directory exists; creating one adds unnecessary structure for three trivial files'
      - 'joke3.md (lowercase) — existing files use uppercase JOKE.md and JOKE2.md; deviating breaks the naming sequence'
    rationale: >
      JOKE.md and JOKE2.md both live at the repository root with uppercase names.
      JOKE3.md is the obvious sequential successor. Placing it anywhere else or
      changing case would create an inconsistency with no benefit.

  - title: 'Markdown Format and Structure'
    chosen: 'H1 heading + bold **Q:** / **A:** block + horizontal rule separator, matching JOKE.md and JOKE2.md exactly'
    rejected:
      - 'Fenced code block for the joke — adds no value and is semantically incorrect for prose content'
      - 'Plain prose one-liner with no Q:/A: structure — acceptable as a secondary addition (JOKE.md line 9) but not as the primary joke; the dominant pattern is Q&A'
    rationale: >
      Both existing files open with `# Joke`, follow with `**Q:**` / `**A:**`
      on separate lines, then a `---` horizontal rule. Replicating this structure
      exactly makes JOKE3.md indistinguishable in style from its predecessors,
      which is the correct outcome for a purely additive content file.

  - title: 'Joke Content Selection'
    chosen: 'Single short programmer/pun joke in Q&A format — inoffensive, groan-worthy'
    rejected:
      - 'Multiple jokes — user explicitly asked for "simple short" and "fast"; adding more jokes expands scope beyond the request'
      - 'Long-form narrative joke — violates NFR-3 (< 1 KB) and contradicts the "stupid/short" requirement'
    rationale: >
      The user's original request was "fast, no research, no thinking". One
      minimal Q&A joke is the smallest deliverable that satisfies all functional
      requirements. Additional jokes or elaborate content would be scope creep.

  - title: 'File Encoding and Line Endings'
    chosen: 'UTF-8 encoding with Unix LF line endings'
    rejected:
      - 'Windows CRLF line endings — existing repo files use LF; mixing endings causes unnecessary diff noise'
      - 'Latin-1 or ASCII-only encoding — UTF-8 is a strict superset and the standard for all modern text files in this repository'
    rationale: >
      NFR-1 explicitly requires UTF-8 with LF. This is also consistent with
      every other Markdown and source file in the repository.

# Open questions (all resolved)
openQuestions:
  - question: 'Should the joke be programmer-themed or general pun?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Programmer/tech-themed joke'
        description: >
          Follows the tone of JOKE.md ("Why do programmers prefer dark mode?")
          and JOKE2.md ("Why do Java developers wear glasses?"). Consistent with
          the existing repo identity and audience.
        selected: true
      - option: 'General pun with no tech angle'
        description: >
          Broadens the humor style. Not inconsistent with the files (JOKE.md line
          9 is a general anti-gravity pun) but breaks the programmer-joke theme
          of the primary Q&A jokes.
        selected: false
      - option: 'Meta joke about the repo or specs process'
        description: >
          Self-referential humor about writing specs for a one-line joke file.
          Clever but could feel forced and does not age well if the repo
          structure changes.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      Both existing primary Q&A jokes are programmer/tech-themed. Staying in that
      category is the most consistent choice and requires the least deliberation
      — which aligns with the user's "no thinking" directive.

  ## Technology Decisions

  ### 1. File Location and Naming

  **Chosen:** `/JOKE3.md` at the repository root

  **Rejected:**
  - `jokes/JOKE3.md` in a subdirectory — no `jokes/` directory exists; creating one adds unnecessary structure for three trivial files
  - `joke3.md` (lowercase) — existing files use uppercase `JOKE.md` and `JOKE2.md`; deviating breaks the naming sequence

  **Rationale:** `JOKE.md` and `JOKE2.md` both live at the repository root with
  uppercase names. `JOKE3.md` is the obvious sequential successor.

  ### 2. Markdown Format and Structure

  **Chosen:** H1 heading + bold `**Q:**` / `**A:**` block + `---` horizontal rule

  **Rejected:**
  - Fenced code block — semantically incorrect for prose joke content
  - Plain prose one-liner only — the dominant pattern in both existing files is Q&A; one-liners are secondary

  **Rationale:** Both `JOKE.md` and `JOKE2.md` open with `# Joke`, use `**Q:**`
  and `**A:**` on separate paragraphs, then close with `---`. Exact replication
  is the correct approach.

  ### 3. Joke Content Selection

  **Chosen:** Single short programmer/pun Q&A joke

  **Rejected:**
  - Multiple jokes — expands scope beyond "simple short fast"
  - Long-form narrative — violates NFR-3 (< 1 KB) and "stupid/short" requirement

  **Rationale:** One joke is the minimal viable deliverable. The user asked for
  something fast with no overthinking.

  ### 4. File Encoding and Line Endings

  **Chosen:** UTF-8, Unix LF

  **Rejected:**
  - CRLF — causes diff noise, inconsistent with repo
  - Latin-1/ASCII — UTF-8 is the repo standard

  **Rationale:** NFR-1 explicitly requires UTF-8 with LF, consistent with all
  other files in the repository.

  ## Library Analysis

  | Library | Purpose | Decision | Reasoning |
  | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
  | None    | N/A     | N/A      | This is a pure content file; no libraries, build tools, or dependencies are involved |

  ## Security Considerations

  None. A static Markdown file with no executable code, no user input, and no
  dynamic content has zero security surface area. The only constraint (NFR-2)
  is that the joke content must be inoffensive — enforced by author review,
  not tooling.

  ## Performance Implications

  None. The file is < 1 KB of static text. GitHub renders it client-side with
  negligible cost. No caching, CDN, or build pipeline changes are required.

  ## Architecture Notes

  This feature is entirely additive and isolated. It touches no source code,
  no configuration, and no existing files. It has no dependencies and nothing
  depends on it. The "architecture" is: create one file, done.
