# Implementation Plan (YAML)
# This is the source of truth. Markdown is auto-generated from this file.

name: joke-markdown-file
summary: >
  Create a single new Markdown file (JOKE3.md) at the repository root,
  following the exact format established by JOKE.md and JOKE2.md. No source
  code changes. One phase, one task.

  ## Status

  - **Phase:** Planning
  - **Updated:** 2026-02-26

  ## Architecture Overview

  This feature is a pure content addition with no architectural impact. The
  repository already establishes a convention with JOKE.md and JOKE2.md at the
  root. JOKE3.md is the next file in that sequence. Nothing in the build
  pipeline, CI configuration, or source code is affected.

  ## Key Design Decisions

  ### File Location and Naming
  **Chosen:** `/JOKE3.md` at the repository root.
  JOKE.md and JOKE2.md both live at the root with uppercase names. Sequential
  naming is the only consistent choice. Deviating adds no value and breaks
  the established pattern.

  ### Markdown Format
  **Chosen:** H1 heading (`# Joke`) + `**Q:**` / `**A:**` paragraphs + `---`
  horizontal rule separator, identical to both existing files.
  Replicating the existing structure makes JOKE3.md indistinguishable in style
  from its predecessors, which is the correct outcome for a purely additive
  content file.

  ### Joke Content
  **Chosen:** Single short programmer/tech-themed pun in Q&A format.
  Both existing primary jokes are programmer-themed. One joke satisfies the
  user's explicit "simple short fast" request without scope creep. NFR-2
  requires inoffensive content — pun/programmer humor is the safest category.

  ### Encoding
  **Chosen:** UTF-8 with Unix LF line endings.
  Required by NFR-1 and consistent with every other file in the repository.

  ## Implementation Strategy

  Single phase, single task: write the file. There is no dependency chain,
  no build step, and no integration work required. The task is complete the
  moment the file exists at the repository root with valid content.

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | Wrong file location | Place at repository root alongside JOKE.md and JOKE2.md |
  | Format inconsistency | Reference existing files before writing content |
  | Offensive content | Use inoffensive programmer pun; no discriminatory humor |
  | Wrong line endings | Use Unix LF; consistent with repo standard |
