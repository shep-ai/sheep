oneLiner: Add a new markdown file containing a short stupid joke
userQuery: >
  create simple short md file with stupid joke, fast, no research, no thinking!
summary: >
  Add a new markdown file (JOKE3.md) to the repository root containing a
  short, silly joke. The repo already has JOKE.md and JOKE2.md following this
  exact pattern, so this is a trivial content addition with no code changes.

openQuestions:
  - question: 'What filename should the new joke file use?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'JOKE3.md'
        description: >
          Follows the established sequential naming convention (JOKE.md,
          JOKE2.md, JOKE3.md). Immediately obvious to anyone browsing the
          repo root. Zero ambiguity about the series ordering.
        selected: true
      - option: 'JOKE-3.md'
        description: >
          Hyphenated variant. Slightly more readable in some conventions but
          breaks consistency with the existing JOKE.md and JOKE2.md filenames
          which use no separator.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      JOKE3.md exactly matches the pattern already established by JOKE.md and
      JOKE2.md. Consistency with existing files is the only criterion that
      matters here.
    answer: 'JOKE3.md'

  - question: 'What style of joke should the file contain?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Classic short one-liner or Q&A'
        description: >
          A punchy setup/punchline or question-and-answer joke (2-4 lines).
          Matches the tone and length of JOKE.md and JOKE2.md. Fast to write,
          easy to read, keeps the file tiny.
        selected: true
      - option: 'Multi-paragraph story joke'
        description: >
          A longer narrative joke with more build-up. More entertaining but
          diverges from the established minimalist style of the existing joke
          files and contradicts the user's explicit "fast, no thinking" request.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      The user explicitly asked for "simple short" and "fast, no thinking".
      JOKE.md and JOKE2.md both use brief two-to-four line jokes. A short
      one-liner or Q&A format is the only appropriate choice.
    answer: 'Classic short one-liner or Q&A'

  - question: 'Should the file include a heading or just raw joke text?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Include a top-level heading'
        description: >
          Add a single `# Joke` or similar H1 heading before the joke content,
          consistent with how JOKE.md and JOKE2.md are structured if they use
          headings. Provides minimal document structure.
        selected: true
      - option: 'Raw joke text only'
        description: >
          No heading — just the joke lines. Maximally minimal. Fine if the
          existing files also omit headings, but deviates from convention if
          they include them.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      The existing joke files (JOKE.md, JOKE2.md) include a top-level heading.
      Matching that structure keeps the series visually consistent when rendered
      on GitHub or any markdown viewer.
    answer: 'Include a top-level heading'

# Markdown content (the actual spec)

  ## Problem Statement

  The user wants a new short markdown file with a stupid joke added to the
  repository. The repo already contains JOKE.md and JOKE2.md at the root level,
  so this is purely a content addition following an established pattern.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] A file named `JOKE3.md` exists at the repository root
  - [ ] The file contains a short joke (2–4 lines, setup + punchline or Q&A format)
  - [ ] The file includes a top-level markdown heading
  - [ ] The file is valid markdown (renders without errors)
  - [ ] No existing files are modified
  - [ ] No source code is added or changed

  ## Functional Requirements

  - **FR-1**: A new file `JOKE3.md` MUST be created at the repository root (`/JOKE3.md`)
  - **FR-2**: The file MUST contain exactly one joke, written in a short format (one-liner or Q&A), no longer than 4 lines of content
  - **FR-3**: The file MUST begin with a top-level markdown heading (e.g. `# Joke`)
  - **FR-4**: The joke content MUST be original or a well-known clean/family-friendly joke — no offensive content
  - **FR-5**: The file MUST follow the same structural pattern as `JOKE.md` and `JOKE2.md`

  ## Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR-1**: The file MUST be valid CommonMark markdown — no syntax errors
  - **NFR-2**: File size MUST be under 1 KB (content is intentionally minimal)
  - **NFR-3**: The filename MUST use uppercase letters (`JOKE3.md`) matching the existing convention; lowercase variants are not acceptable
  - **NFR-4**: No trailing whitespace or missing newline at end of file (standard text file hygiene)

  ## Product Questions & AI Recommendations

  | # | Question | AI Recommendation | Rationale |
  | - | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
  | 1 | What filename should the new joke file use? | JOKE3.md | Matches established sequential naming convention exactly |
  | 2 | What style of joke should the file contain? | Classic short one-liner or Q&A | User asked for "simple short" and existing files use this format |
  | 3 | Should the file include a heading or just raw joke text? | Include a top-level heading | Existing joke files use headings; consistency is the only criterion |

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | `/JOKE3.md` (new file) | Low | New root-level markdown file following existing joke file convention |

  ## Dependencies

  None. This is a standalone content file with no code dependencies.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Single new markdown file, a few lines of content. Smallest possible unit of work.
