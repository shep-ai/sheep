    description: >
      Create the file JOKE3.md at the repository root containing a short
      programming joke in Q&A format. The file must exactly follow the
      structure of JOKE2.md: `# Joke` H1 heading, bold `**Q:**`/`**A:**`
      lines, trailing `---` horizontal rule, and a final newline. No existing
      files are modified.

  ## Summary

  A single content-creation task comprises the entire implementation. There
  is no code to write, no tests to run, and no infrastructure to touch. The
  work is: open a new file at `JOKE3.md`, paste in the template derived from
  JOKE2.md with the selected joke, verify structure and hygiene, commit.

  TDD does not apply — this is a static markdown content file with no
  executable behavior to drive with tests.

  ## Implementation Notes

  ### Exact file content to create

  ```markdown
  # Joke

  **Q:** Why do programmers always mix up Halloween and Christmas?

  **A:** Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!

  ---
  ```

  The file must end with a newline character after `---`.

  ### Verification steps before committing

  1. `cat JOKE3.md` — confirm content matches template exactly
  2. `ls -la JOKE3.md` — confirm file is at repo root and under 1 KB
  3. `git diff --stat` — confirm only JOKE3.md is listed as a new file
  4. `git status` — confirm no other files are modified or deleted
