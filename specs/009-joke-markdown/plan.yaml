summary: >
  Create JOKE3.md at the repository root, replicating the exact structure of
  JOKE2.md (the most recent prior art): `# Joke` H1 heading, bold Q&A joke
  lines, trailing `---` horizontal rule. Single-phase, single-file, zero code
  changes. No tests, no dependencies, no risk.

      Create the single file JOKE3.md at the repository root. This is the
      only phase because the entire feature is one file with ~7 lines of
      content. No prior setup, scaffolding, or infrastructure work is needed.

  ## Architecture Overview

  This feature adds one static markdown file to the repository root. It has
  no integration points with any source code, build system, CI pipeline, or
  configuration. It slots into an informal content series alongside the
  already-present JOKE.md and JOKE2.md.

  The "architecture" is the file template itself, derived by reading the two
  existing files:

  ```markdown
  # Joke

  **Q:** <setup line>

  **A:** <punchline>

  ---
  ```

  JOKE2.md is the canonical template. JOKE.md contains three jokes separated
  by `---` (older, denser style); the single-joke structure of JOKE2.md is
  what JOKE3.md must replicate.

  ## Key Design Decisions

  ### 1. File naming: JOKE3.md (not JOKE-3.md or joke3.md)

  The two existing files are JOKE.md and JOKE2.md — uppercase, no separator.
  JOKE3.md is the only name consistent with that convention. Confirmed in spec
  open questions and NFR-3.

  ### 2. File structure: H1 + bold Q&A + trailing `---`

  Derived from reading JOKE2.md directly (see research artifact). Every
  structural element present in the prior file must be replicated:

  - `# Joke` — H1 heading (not `# Joke 3`, not `# JOKE3`)
  - blank line
  - `**Q:** …` — bold label inline with setup
  - blank line
  - `**A:** …` — bold label inline with punchline
  - blank line
  - `---` — closing horizontal rule

  ### 3. Joke content: programming Q&A, not already in JOKE.md or JOKE2.md

  Existing jokes to avoid:
  - JOKE.md: dark-mode/bugs pun, anti-gravity book, reboot-emotions
  - JOKE2.md: Java/C# glasses

  Selected joke: octal/decimal Halloween–Christmas pun ("Why do programmers
  always mix up Halloween and Christmas? Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!"). Classic
  clean programming joke, entirely different from all existing content,
  fits the Q&A format, and matches the wordplay-pun tone of the series.

  ### 4. No trailing whitespace; newline at EOF

  NFR-4 requires standard text file hygiene. File ends with a single `\n`
  after the closing `---` line.

  ## Implementation Strategy

  Single phase, single task: create the file. No setup, no teardown, no
  coordination with other files or systems. All decisions are resolved in
  this plan document; execution is mechanical file creation.

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | Wrong filename casing | Use exact string `JOKE3.md`; confirm with `ls JOKE3.md` after creation |
  | Missing trailing newline | Ensure file content ends with `\n` after `---` |
  | Duplicate joke content | Confirmed selected joke does not appear in JOKE.md or JOKE2.md |
  | Offensive content (FR-4) | Selected joke is a classic clean programming pun with no sensitive content |
  | Accidentally modifying existing files | Task creates only one new file; no edits to any existing file |
