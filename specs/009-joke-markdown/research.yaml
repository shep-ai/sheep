name: joke-markdown
summary: >
  JOKE3.md is a trivial content addition with zero code changes. Research
  confirms the exact file structure by reading JOKE.md and JOKE2.md: both use
  `# Joke` as the H1 heading, bold `**Q:**`/`**A:**` Q&A formatting, and a
  trailing `---` horizontal rule. JOKE3.md must replicate this pattern exactly.

decisions:
  - title: 'File Structure Pattern'
    chosen: 'H1 heading + bold Q&A joke + trailing horizontal rule, matching JOKE2.md'
    rejected:
      - 'Raw joke text only (no heading) — rejected because both JOKE.md and JOKE2.md open with `# Joke`; omitting it breaks visual consistency when rendered on GitHub'
      - 'Multi-joke file like JOKE.md — rejected because JOKE2.md established the single-joke-per-file convention, and the spec explicitly calls for "simple short"'
    rationale: >
      Reading JOKE.md and JOKE2.md reveals the exact template. JOKE2.md is the
      most recent prior art and uses the minimal single-joke structure:
      `# Joke` heading, a blank line, a bold `**Q:**` line, a blank line, a
      bold `**A:**` line, a blank line, and a closing `---`. JOKE3.md must
      follow this identical template. JOKE.md contains three jokes separated
      by `---` which is an older, denser style; JOKE2.md's cleaner one-joke
      format is the pattern to follow.

  - title: 'Joke Content Selection'
    chosen: 'A new clean Q&A programming/general joke not already present in JOKE.md or JOKE2.md'
    rejected:
      - 'Reusing a joke from JOKE.md or JOKE2.md — rejected because the repo already contains those; duplication adds no value and would be immediately visible to anyone browsing the files'
      - 'A non-programming or niche-topic joke — rejected because JOKE.md and JOKE2.md are both programming-flavored (dark mode bugs, Java/C#); staying in that theme keeps the series cohesive'
    rationale: >
      JOKE.md uses: dark mode/bugs pun, anti-gravity book pun, reboot-emotions
      pun. JOKE2.md uses: Java/C# glasses pun. The chosen joke must be
      different from all of these, programming-adjacent, clean/family-friendly
      (FR-4), and short enough to fit in 4 lines of content (FR-2). A
      classic Q&A format satisfies all constraints and matches both existing
      files exactly.

  - title: 'Trailing Horizontal Rule'
    chosen: 'Include a closing `---` after the joke, matching JOKE2.md'
    rejected:
      - 'No trailing `---` — rejected because JOKE2.md ends with `---` and omitting it would be the only structural difference between files, creating needless inconsistency'
      - 'Multiple `---` separators (JOKE.md style) — rejected because that pattern was used to separate multiple jokes within one file; JOKE3.md has only one joke so multiple rules are not applicable'
    rationale: >
      JOKE2.md ends with a `---` on line 7. This appears to be the settled
      convention for single-joke files in the series. Replicating it ensures
      the files are structurally identical and renders consistently in any
      markdown viewer.

  ## Status

  - **Phase:** Research
  - **Updated:** 2026-02-26

  ## Existing Pattern (from codebase)

  Reading `JOKE.md` and `JOKE2.md` reveals the exact template to follow.

  **JOKE2.md** (most recent, cleanest):
  ```markdown
  # Joke

  **Q:** Why do Java developers wear glasses?

  **A:** Because they don't C#!

  ---
  ```

  **JOKE.md** contains three jokes separated by `---`, making it a denser
  format. JOKE2.md's single-joke structure is the correct template for JOKE3.md.

  ## Technology Decisions

  ### 1. File Structure Pattern

  **Chosen:** H1 heading + bold Q&A joke + trailing horizontal rule, matching JOKE2.md

  **Rejected:**
  - Raw joke text only — breaks heading consistency with both existing files
  - Multi-joke file (JOKE.md style) — contradicts "simple short" user request and JOKE2.md convention

  **Rationale:** JOKE2.md is the most recent file in the series and defines
  the minimal one-joke template. Exact replication is the only correct choice.

  ### 2. Joke Content Selection

  **Chosen:** A new clean Q&A programming joke not already in JOKE.md or JOKE2.md

  **Rejected:**
  - Duplicate of existing jokes — immediately visible duplication, zero value
  - Non-programming topic — breaks thematic consistency of the series

  **Rationale:** All existing jokes are programming-flavored puns. Staying
  in that theme and avoiding duplication are the only content constraints.

  ### 3. Trailing Horizontal Rule

  **Chosen:** Include closing `---` matching JOKE2.md

  **Rejected:**
  - No trailing `---` — inconsistent with JOKE2.md structure
  - Multiple `---` separators — only needed for multi-joke files

  **Rationale:** JOKE2.md ends with `---`; JOKE3.md must match exactly.

  ## Library Analysis

  | Library | Purpose | Decision | Reasoning |
  | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
  | None    | N/A     | N/A      | Pure content file — no libraries, no tooling, no dependencies |

  ## Security Considerations

  No security implications. This is a static markdown file with no executable
  code, no user input, no data storage, and no external dependencies. The only
  content concern is FR-4: the joke must be clean/family-friendly with no
  offensive content.

  ## Performance Implications

  No performance implications. File size will be well under 1 KB (NFR-2).
  Markdown rendering is handled entirely by the viewer (GitHub, etc.) with
  zero application-level impact.

  ## Architecture Notes

  This feature touches exactly one artifact: `/JOKE3.md` at the repository
  root. No source code, configuration, tests, or CI pipelines are affected.
  The file slots into an existing informal series (JOKE.md, JOKE2.md) with no
  integration points. Implementation is create-file-and-done.
