      Create SHEEP.md at the repository root with an H1 heading and a whimsical short story
      (4–8 sentences) about sheep. This is the only phase because the entire deliverable is
      a single static file with no dependencies on other changes.

  ## Architecture Overview

  This feature has no architectural footprint. It adds one standalone Markdown file to the
  repository root — the same location as JOKE.md and README.md. No source code, tests,
  configuration, CI/CD pipelines, or infrastructure are touched.

  The relevant "architecture" is the existing convention for root-level Markdown files:

  | File       | H1 Heading  | Content Type       | Encoding       |
  | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
  | README.md  | `# Sheep`   | Project overview   | UTF-8 / LF     |
  | JOKE.md    | `# Joke`    | Q&A joke + quip    | UTF-8 / LF     |
  | SHEEP.md   | `# A Sheep Story` | Prose narrative | UTF-8 / LF  |

  SHEEP.md slots cleanly into this pattern without modifying anything.

  ## Key Design Decisions

  ### 1. Filename: `SHEEP.md` (uppercase)
  JOKE.md and README.md both use uppercase filenames at the repo root. NFR-2 mandates this
  explicitly. No deviation.

  ### 2. Heading: `# A Sheep Story`
  JOKE.md uses `# Joke`; README.md uses `# Sheep`. The pattern is H1 as the first line.
  `# A Sheep Story` is descriptive and mirrors the lighthearted tone. The spec resolved this
  question in favour of "H1 heading (# Story)" — this wording is slightly more evocative
  than the bare `# Story` while remaining concise.

  ### 3. Content: flowing prose, no special Markdown syntax
  The spec explicitly selected "Whimsical short story" over limerick or facts list.
  JOKE.md uses bold Q&A formatting because it is a joke; a narrative story reads best as
  plain prose sentences. No lists, tables, code fences, or embedded HTML.

  ### 4. Optional horizontal rule (`---`)
  JOKE.md includes a `---` separator between the joke and the bonus quip. Since SHEEP.md
  is a single continuous story (no two-part structure), no separator is needed. Omitting it
  keeps the file simpler and avoids visual noise.

  ### 5. Encoding: UTF-8 / Unix LF
  NFR-4 is explicit. All existing repo files use this encoding. No deviation.

  ## Implementation Strategy

  The entire implementation fits in a single phase (Content Creation) with one task.
  There are no blocking dependencies, no setup steps, and no teardown steps.

  The only ordering constraint is that the file must exist before it can be verified —
  trivially satisfied by writing it first and reviewing it second within the same task.

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | Story lacks narrative arc (opening / event / resolution) | Outline the three beats before writing; verify before committing |
  | File uses CRLF line endings (Windows editor default) | Use a tool or editor configured for LF; verify with `file` or `cat -A` if in doubt |
  | Filename casing error (sheep.md vs SHEEP.md) | Confirm filename after creation; git is case-sensitive on Linux |
  | Content is not family-friendly | Read through before committing; apply common-sense review |
  | Story is fewer than 4 or more than 8 sentences | Count sentences explicitly during authoring |
