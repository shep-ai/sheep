# Research Artifact (YAML)
# This is the source of truth. Markdown is auto-generated from this file.

name: sheep-story
summary: >
  This is a content-only task with no code, libraries, or infrastructure involved.
  The sole deliverable is a new SHEEP.md file at the repository root following the
  exact conventions established by JOKE.md (H1 heading, plain Markdown prose, Unix
  line endings, UTF-8 encoding, uppercase filename).

# Structured technology decisions
decisions:
  - title: 'File Naming Convention'
    chosen: 'SHEEP.md (uppercase, matching JOKE.md and README.md)'
    rejected:
      - 'sheep.md (lowercase) — inconsistent with JOKE.md and README.md conventions already in the repo root'
      - 'Sheep.md (title case) — mixed case not used anywhere in the repo root; violates NFR-2'
    rationale: >
      The repo root already contains JOKE.md and README.md, both uppercase. NFR-2 explicitly
      mandates the uppercase convention. No deviation is warranted.

  - title: 'Markdown Heading'
    chosen: 'H1 heading (# A Sheep Story)'
    rejected:
      - 'No heading — JOKE.md uses `# Joke`; omitting a heading breaks visual consistency when rendered on GitHub'
      - 'H2 heading (## A Sheep Story) — H1 is the established root-level document convention in this repo (README.md, JOKE.md both use H1)'
    rationale: >
      JOKE.md opens with `# Joke`. README.md opens with `# Sheep`. The pattern is
      unambiguous: root-level Markdown files in this repo use a single H1 as the first line.
      The spec also explicitly selects this option (openQuestions answer: "H1 heading (# Story)").

  - title: 'Story Content Structure'
    chosen: 'Plain Markdown prose paragraphs (no lists, no bold Q&A, no special formatting)'
    rejected:
      - 'Bold Q&A format (like JOKE.md lines 3–5) — that structure is specific to a joke format; a narrative story should read as flowing prose'
      - 'Bulleted list of facts — diverges from the "story" framing; the spec explicitly rejected this option in openQuestions'
    rationale: >
      JOKE.md uses **Q:** / **A:** formatting because it is a joke. A whimsical short story
      is a different content type; flowing prose sentences are the natural fit. The spec's
      own openQuestions resolution selected "Whimsical short story" over poem or facts list,
      and described it as "a brief narrative with a beginning, middle, and end."
      No special Markdown syntax (tables, code blocks, images) is needed or appropriate.

  - title: 'File Encoding and Line Endings'
    chosen: 'UTF-8 encoding with Unix LF line endings'
    rejected:
      - 'UTF-8 with CRLF (Windows) line endings — inconsistent with existing repo files; NFR-4 mandates LF'
      - 'ASCII-only content restriction — unnecessary; UTF-8 is a strict superset and handles any punctuation gracefully'
    rationale: >
      NFR-4 explicitly requires UTF-8 and Unix line endings. All existing repo files
      (JOKE.md, README.md) already use this encoding. No deviation is warranted.

  - title: 'Repository Placement'
    chosen: 'Repository root (same directory as JOKE.md and README.md)'
    rejected:
      - 'docs/ subdirectory — no such convention exists in this repo; would diverge from the JOKE.md precedent'
      - 'src/ or any source directory — content files are not source code; placing there would be semantically wrong'
    rationale: >
      FR-1 explicitly states the file must be created at the repository root, same level as
      JOKE.md. The existing pattern (JOKE.md, README.md at root) confirms this is the correct
      location for standalone Markdown content files.

  ## Status

  - **Phase:** Research
  - **Updated:** 2026-02-26

  ## Summary

  This is a pure content-creation task. There are no code changes, no library dependencies,
  no API design decisions, no schema changes, and no security or performance considerations
  beyond those that apply to any static text file in a public repository.

  All research effort is focused on ensuring the new file precisely follows existing
  conventions so it fits naturally alongside JOKE.md and README.md.

  ## Technology Decisions

  ### 1. File Naming Convention

  **Chosen:** `SHEEP.md` (uppercase)

  **Rejected:**
  - `sheep.md` (lowercase) — breaks consistency with `JOKE.md` and `README.md`
  - `Sheep.md` (title case) — not used anywhere in the repo root; violates NFR-2

  **Rationale:** The repo already establishes an uppercase convention for root-level
  Markdown files. NFR-2 mandates it explicitly.

  ---

  ### 2. Markdown Heading

  **Chosen:** H1 heading (`# A Sheep Story`)

  **Rejected:**
  - No heading — inconsistent with `JOKE.md` (`# Joke`) and `README.md` (`# Sheep`)
  - H2 heading — H1 is the root document convention across all repo Markdown files

  **Rationale:** Every root-level Markdown file in this repo opens with an H1. The spec
  explicitly resolves this question in favour of "H1 heading (# Story)". Using
  `# A Sheep Story` is descriptive and mirrors the light style of the existing files.

  ---

  ### 3. Story Content Structure

  **Chosen:** Plain Markdown prose (flowing sentences, no lists or special formatting)

  **Rejected:**
  - Bold Q&A format — specific to jokes; unsuitable for narrative prose
  - Bulleted fact list — explicitly rejected in spec openQuestions; lacks narrative arc

  **Rationale:** A whimsical short story is best expressed as flowing prose paragraphs.
  No additional Markdown syntax (tables, code fences, images, footnotes) is needed.
  The JOKE.md horizontal rule (`---`) is optional decoration and may be included for
  visual consistency, but is not required.

  ---

  ### 4. File Encoding and Line Endings

  **Chosen:** UTF-8, Unix LF (`\n`)

  **Rejected:**
  - CRLF line endings — violates NFR-4; inconsistent with all existing repo files
  - ASCII-only restriction — unnecessary; UTF-8 is standard and already used repo-wide

  **Rationale:** NFR-4 is explicit. All existing files use this encoding. No deviation needed.

  ---

  ### 5. Repository Placement

  **Chosen:** Repository root

  **Rejected:**
  - `docs/` subdirectory — no such convention; diverges from JOKE.md precedent
  - `src/` or other source directories — semantically wrong for a content file

  **Rationale:** FR-1 is explicit. JOKE.md is at root. README.md is at root. SHEEP.md goes at root.

  ## Library Analysis

  | Library | Purpose | Decision | Reasoning |
  | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
  | None    | N/A     | N/A      | Pure Markdown content — no tooling required |

  ---

  ## Security Considerations

  - The file is static Markdown text with no executable content, no links to external
    resources, and no embedded HTML. There are no XSS, injection, or data-exposure risks.
  - NFR-3 requires family-friendly content appropriate for a public open-source repository.
    The story must be reviewed for appropriateness before commit.
  - No credentials, API keys, or sensitive data should appear in the file.

  ---

  ## Performance Implications

  None. A small static Markdown file has negligible impact on repository size, clone time,
  or CI/CD pipeline duration.

  ---

  ## Architecture Notes

  This feature has no architectural impact. It adds a single standalone content file to the
  repository root. No existing files are modified (NFR-5). No source code, tests, configuration,
  or infrastructure is touched.

  The implementation mirrors feature 006 (JOKE.md) exactly in structure and scope. The only
  difference is the content type (story vs. joke) and filename (SHEEP.md vs. JOKE.md).
