    title: 'Create SHEEP.md with whimsical sheep story'
    description: >
      Write a new file SHEEP.md at the repository root. The file must open with the H1
      heading `# A Sheep Story`, followed by a 4–8 sentence whimsical prose narrative
      featuring sheep as the primary subject, with a clear opening, central event, and
      resolution. The file must use UTF-8 encoding and Unix LF line endings. No existing
      files may be modified.

      - 'File SHEEP.md exists at the repository root (same level as JOKE.md and README.md)'
      - 'First line is an H1 Markdown heading (e.g., `# A Sheep Story`)'
      - 'Story body is plain prose — no lists, tables, code fences, or embedded HTML'
      - 'Story is 4–8 sentences in length (counted explicitly)'
      - 'Story has a discernible opening, central event or conflict, and resolution'
      - 'Sheep are the primary subject or protagonist of the story'
      - 'Content is original, coherent, and family-friendly'
      - 'File renders without errors as Markdown (no broken syntax)'
      - 'Filename is uppercase: SHEEP.md (not sheep.md or Sheep.md)'
      - 'File uses UTF-8 encoding and Unix LF line endings'

  ## Summary

  The entire deliverable is a single file: SHEEP.md at the repository root. There are no
  setup tasks, no teardown tasks, and no dependencies between tasks — because there is only
  one task.

  The implementation follows the JOKE.md precedent exactly in structure (uppercase filename,
  H1 heading, plain Markdown, UTF-8 / LF) while differing in content type (flowing prose
  story rather than a Q&A joke format). No TDD cycle applies because there is no executable
  code; acceptance is verified by reading the file and checking each criterion manually.

  The work is: open an editor, write the story, save the file, review against the acceptance
  criteria, commit.
