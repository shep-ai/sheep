oneLiner: Create a single markdown file with a short random story about sheep
summary: >

openQuestions:
  - question: 'What narrative style should the sheep story use?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Whimsical short story'
        description: >
          A brief narrative (3–6 sentences) with a beginning, middle, and end. Characters, setting,
          and a light comedic or heartwarming resolution. Matches the tone of JOKE.md and feels
          complete as a standalone piece of content.
        selected: true
      - option: 'Limerick or poem'
        description: >
          A rhyming verse about sheep. Fun and compact, but less story-like and harder to write
          well without feeling forced.
        selected: false
      - option: 'Fun facts list'
        description: >
          A bulleted list of quirky sheep facts presented as a "story." Easy to write but lacks
          narrative cohesion and diverges from the "story" framing in the task.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      A whimsical short story best fulfills the "story" intent in the task description, matches
      the lighthearted tone of JOKE.md, and produces a self-contained piece that reads naturally
      on GitHub. It's the most fitting interpretation of the one-liner.
    answer: 'Whimsical short story'

  - question: 'What length should the story be?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'Very short (1–3 sentences)'
        description: >
          Minimal content — a single punchline or micro-vignette. Fast to produce but may feel
          thin or incomplete as a "story."
        selected: false
      - option: 'Short (4–8 sentences)'
        description: >
          Enough to establish a character, a small conflict or event, and a resolution. Satisfying
          as a standalone read without overstaying its welcome. Matches the scope of JOKE.md.
        selected: true
      - option: 'Medium (1–2 paragraphs)'
        description: >
          More developed narrative with richer detail. Slightly over-engineered for an S-sized
          content task, but still acceptable.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      4–8 sentences gives the story enough structure to feel complete (character + event +
      resolution) while keeping the scope firmly at size S. JOKE.md is ~2–3 lines; a story
      warrants slightly more space but should stay concise.
    answer: 'Short (4–8 sentences)'

  - question: 'Should the file include a Markdown heading?'
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: 'H1 heading (# Story)'
        description: >
          Adds a top-level heading matching the JOKE.md pattern (which uses `# Joke`). Consistent
          with existing conventions and renders cleanly on GitHub.
        selected: true
      - option: 'No heading'
        description: >
          Story begins immediately with prose. Less formal, but inconsistent with the JOKE.md
          precedent and lacks a visual anchor when rendered.
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: >
      JOKE.md uses a `# Joke` heading. Consistency with the established pattern is the clear
      default here — use `# Story` or `# A Sheep Story` as the H1.
    answer: 'H1 heading (# Story)'

  ## Problem Statement

  The user wants a short, fun markdown file containing a story about sheep added to the
  repository root. No code changes are needed — this is pure content creation following the same
  pattern as the existing JOKE.md file.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] A file named `SHEEP.md` exists at the repository root
  - [ ] The file contains a top-level H1 Markdown heading
  - [ ] The file contains a whimsical short story about sheep (4–8 sentences)
  - [ ] The story is original, coherent, and has a clear beginning, middle, and end
  - [ ] The file renders correctly as Markdown (no syntax errors, no broken formatting)
  - [ ] The file follows the uppercase naming convention consistent with `JOKE.md` and `README.md`
  - [ ] No source code files are modified

  ## Functional Requirements

  - **FR-1**: A new file `SHEEP.md` MUST be created at the repository root (same level as `JOKE.md`).
  - **FR-2**: The file MUST begin with a top-level Markdown heading (`# ...`), consistent with `JOKE.md`.
  - **FR-3**: The file MUST contain a short story about sheep, written in a whimsical/lighthearted narrative style.
  - **FR-4**: The story MUST be 4–8 sentences in length.
  - **FR-5**: The story MUST have a discernible narrative arc: an opening, a central event or conflict, and a resolution or punchline.
  - **FR-6**: The story MUST feature sheep as the primary subject or protagonist.

  ## Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR-1**: The file MUST be valid Markdown that renders without errors on GitHub.
  - **NFR-2**: The filename MUST use the established uppercase convention (`SHEEP.md`, not `sheep.md` or `Sheep.md`).
  - **NFR-3**: The content MUST be family-friendly and appropriate for a public open-source repository.
  - **NFR-4**: The file MUST use UTF-8 encoding and Unix line endings (`\n`), consistent with other repo files.
  - **NFR-5**: No existing files may be modified as part of this change.

  ## Product Questions & AI Recommendations

  | # | Question | AI Recommendation | Rationale |
  | - | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
  | 1 | What narrative style should the sheep story use? | Whimsical short story | Best fulfills "story" intent; matches JOKE.md tone; self-contained on GitHub |
  | 2 | What length should the story be? | Short (4–8 sentences) | Complete narrative arc without over-engineering an S-sized task |
  | 3 | Should the file include a Markdown heading? | H1 heading (# Story) | Consistent with JOKE.md pattern (`# Joke`); clean GitHub rendering |

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | repo root | Low | Adding a single new markdown file (SHEEP.md) |

  ## Dependencies

  None. No existing code, libraries, or infrastructure required.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Single file creation with no code, no tests, no integration. Minutes of work.
  Identical in scope to feature 006 (JOKE.md). Requirements analysis has not changed this estimate.
