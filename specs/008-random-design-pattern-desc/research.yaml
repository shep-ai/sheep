summary: >
  This is a pure content addition requiring no code changes, libraries, or architectural
  decisions beyond markdown formatting conventions. The Observer pattern (GoF behavioral)
  was selected as the design pattern to document; content structure follows the JOKE.md
  precedent established by features 006/007.

decisions:
  - title: 'Design Pattern Selection'
    chosen: 'Observer pattern (GoF Behavioral)'
    rejected:
      - 'Singleton — overused, widely considered an anti-pattern in modern code; less educational value'
      - 'Factory Method — common but requires more structural explanation (creator/product hierarchy) that risks exceeding the 150–400 word NFR-3 limit while remaining clear'
    rationale: >
      Observer is a well-known, unambiguously named GoF behavioral pattern with a clear
      problem statement (one-to-many state change notification), a self-contained solution
      structure (subject + observers), and obvious real-world examples (event systems, UI
      frameworks, pub/sub messaging). It satisfies FR-5 (recognized GoF pattern), fits
      comfortably within the 150–400 word budget (NFR-3), and is universally understood
      without controversy. Singleton was rejected because it is widely regarded as
      problematic and teaches poor practices. Factory Method was rejected because clearly
      explaining creator/product roles risks word-count bloat to remain unambiguous.

  - title: 'Content Structure and Sections'
    chosen: 'H1 title, then four short sections: Category, Intent, Structure, Example — all prose, no code blocks'
    rejected:
      - 'Include a code snippet — adds length beyond NFR-3 word budget, requires choosing a language (introduces bias), and is not required by FR-4'
      - 'Single flowing paragraph without section headings — harder to skim; reduces usefulness as a technical reference (contradicts NFR-4 "informative and neutral")'
    rationale: >
      FR-4 requires four content areas: (a) name and category, (b) intent/problem, (c)
      solution structure, and (d) a short example or use case. Using short H2 or bold-label
      sections for each makes the file scannable and matches the "informative and neutral"
      tone of NFR-4. A code block is not required by any FR and would push word count
      toward the upper bound; plain English examples (e.g., "a UI button notifying
      registered listeners") satisfy FR-4(d) without language lock-in. The structure
      mirrors a technical glossary entry, which is the appropriate register for this file.

  - title: 'File Formatting Conventions'
    chosen: 'Uppercase filename DESIGN_PATTERN.md, UTF-8 encoding, Unix trailing newline (\\n), valid GitHub Flavored Markdown'
    rejected:
      - 'Lowercase filename design-pattern.md — breaks uppercase convention established by JOKE.md and README.md at repo root (contradicts NFR-5 and spec open question resolution)'
      - 'Windows-style line endings (CRLF) — not consistent with Unix-native repo; violates NFR-2 which specifies Unix trailing newline'
    rationale: >
      The spec explicitly resolves the filename question (DESIGN_PATTERN.md, selected:true)
      citing the uppercase convention of existing root-level content files. NFR-2 mandates
      UTF-8 with Unix-style trailing newline. NFR-1 requires valid GFM. These are all
      non-negotiable from the spec; no alternative is viable within stated requirements.

  ## Technology Decisions

  ### 1. Design Pattern Selection

  **Chosen:** Observer pattern (GoF Behavioral)

  **Rejected:**
  - Singleton — overused and widely considered an anti-pattern; lower educational value
  - Factory Method — clear explanation requires enough structural detail (creator/product hierarchy) that risks exceeding the 150–400 word NFR-3 budget

  **Rationale:** Observer has a crisp, self-contained problem statement, a straightforward
  solution structure, and universally recognizable real-world examples (event systems, UI
  callbacks, pub/sub). It satisfies FR-5, fits within NFR-3, and teaches sound design.

  ### 2. Content Structure

  **Chosen:** H1 title + four short labeled sections (Category, Intent, Structure, Example) — prose only, no code blocks

  **Rejected:**
  - Include a code snippet — not required by FR-4, adds length, forces language choice
  - Single prose paragraph — not scannable; contradicts NFR-4 "informative and neutral" register

  **Rationale:** FR-4 explicitly lists four required content areas. Mapping each to a
  labeled section produces a scannable technical reference. Plain English examples satisfy
  FR-4(d) without language lock-in.

  ### 3. File Formatting

  **Chosen:** DESIGN_PATTERN.md, UTF-8, Unix trailing newline, valid GFM

  **Rejected:**
  - Lowercase filename — breaks repo uppercase convention (NFR-5, spec open question)
  - CRLF line endings — violates NFR-2

  **Rationale:** All formatting choices are fully specified by the feature spec's FRs/NFRs
  and the resolved open question. No deviation is appropriate.

  ## Library Analysis

  | Library | Purpose | Decision | Reasoning |
  | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
  | None    | —       | N/A      | Pure markdown content file; no tooling, dependencies, or libraries required |

  ## Security Considerations

  No security implications. This feature adds a static, read-only markdown content file
  with no executable code, no user input, no network requests, and no data handling.
  The file poses no attack surface.

  ## Performance Implications

  No performance implications. A single small text file (~200–400 words) has negligible
  impact on repository size, clone time, or any runtime behavior. The Python codebase
  is entirely unaffected.

  ## Architecture Notes

  This feature has no architectural impact. It adds one standalone file to the repository
  root following the exact same pattern as JOKE.md (features 006/007): uppercase filename,
  H1 heading, concise prose content, UTF-8, trailing newline. The Python/CrewAI application
  code is untouched. No imports, no modules, no configuration changes needed.
