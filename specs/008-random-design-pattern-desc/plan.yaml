summary: >
  Pure content addition: create DESIGN_PATTERN.md at the repository root describing
  the Observer pattern (GoF Behavioral). No code changes, no dependencies. Follows
  the exact same conventions established by JOKE.md in features 006 and 007.

      Create DESIGN_PATTERN.md at the repository root with Observer pattern content
      satisfying all FRs and NFRs. This is the only phase — the entire feature is a

  ## Architecture Overview

  This feature adds one standalone markdown file to the repository root. It has no
  architectural impact on the Python/CrewAI application. The precedent is JOKE.md
  (features 006/007): an uppercase-named, H1-headed, concise prose file at the repo
  root. DESIGN_PATTERN.md follows that pattern exactly.

  ## Key Design Decisions

  ### 1. Pattern Selection: Observer (GoF Behavioral)

  Chosen over Singleton (widely considered an anti-pattern; poor educational value)
  and Factory Method (creator/product hierarchy explanation risks exceeding the
  150–400 word NFR-3 budget). Observer has a crisp problem statement, a clean
  two-role structure (subject + observers), and universally recognizable real-world
  analogues (event listeners, pub/sub, UI callbacks). It satisfies FR-5 without
  controversy and teaches sound design principles.

  ### 2. Content Structure: H1 + four labeled sections, prose only

  FR-4 requires four content areas: (a) name and category, (b) intent/problem,
  (c) solution structure, and (d) example. Mapping each to a short labeled section
  (H2 or bold) produces a scannable technical reference matching NFR-4 ("informative
  and neutral"). No code blocks — not required by FR-4, would force a language
  choice, and risks pushing word count beyond NFR-3's upper bound of 400 words.

  ### 3. File Formatting: DESIGN_PATTERN.md, UTF-8, Unix LF, valid GFM

  All formatting choices are non-negotiable per the spec's resolved open questions
  and NFR-1/NFR-2/NFR-5. Uppercase filename matches JOKE.md and README.md. Unix
  trailing newline is mandated by NFR-2. Valid GFM is mandated by NFR-1.

  ## Implementation Strategy

  Single phase, single task. The feature is entirely self-contained: write the file,
  verify it meets all success criteria, done. No setup, no build steps, no test suite
  changes required. The only validation needed is a manual checklist against the
  spec's success criteria (filename, heading, four content areas, encoding, newline,
  no existing files modified).

  ## Risk Mitigation

  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | File saved with CRLF line endings | Verify line endings after creation; use Unix LF explicitly |
  | Content exceeds 400-word NFR-3 limit | Draft all four sections, check word count before finalizing |
  | Markdown syntax error breaks GitHub rendering | Use only standard GFM constructs (headings, paragraphs, bold); avoid tables and HTML |
  | Wrong filename casing | Filename is DESIGN_PATTERN.md — all caps, underscore separator, .md extension |
  | Accidentally modifying an existing file | Only create DESIGN_PATTERN.md; verify git status shows only one new untracked file |
