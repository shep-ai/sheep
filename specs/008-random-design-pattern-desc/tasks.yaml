    title: 'Create DESIGN_PATTERN.md with Observer pattern description'
    description: >
      Write DESIGN_PATTERN.md to the repository root containing a short, informative
      description of the Observer design pattern. The file must satisfy all FRs and NFRs:
      uppercase filename, H1 heading with pattern name, four content sections (category,
      intent, structure, example), 150–400 words, UTF-8 encoding, Unix trailing newline,
      valid GitHub Flavored Markdown, and no modifications to any existing file.
    state: Todo
    dependencies: []
    acceptanceCriteria:
      - 'File DESIGN_PATTERN.md exists at the repository root'
      - 'File contains an H1 heading that includes the pattern name (Observer)'
      - 'File covers all four FR-4 content areas: category, intent/problem, solution structure, and a real-world example'
      - 'Word count is between 150 and 400 words (NFR-3)'
      - 'File is valid GitHub Flavored Markdown with no broken syntax'
      - 'File is UTF-8 encoded with a Unix-style trailing newline (no CRLF)'
      - 'The described pattern is the Observer pattern from GoF (satisfies FR-5)'
      - 'No existing files in the repository are modified (git status shows only DESIGN_PATTERN.md as new)'
      - 'Writing style is informative and neutral — not conversational or humorous (NFR-4)'

  ## Status

  - **Phase:** Implementation
  - **Updated:** 2026-02-26

  ## Summary

  A single task in a single phase. There is no code to write, no libraries to install,
  and no test suite to update — this feature is entirely a content addition. The task
  is to author DESIGN_PATTERN.md with Observer pattern content that satisfies all
  functional and non-functional requirements from the spec. Once the file exists and
  passes the acceptance criteria checklist, the feature is complete. TDD does not apply
  to markdown content files.
