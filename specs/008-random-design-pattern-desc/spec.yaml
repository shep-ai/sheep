oneLiner: Add a markdown file containing a short description of a random software design pattern
summary: >
  Create a new markdown file (DESIGN_PATTERN.md) in the repository root containing a short,
  informative description of a randomly chosen software design pattern (e.g., Singleton, Observer,
  Strategy). This is a content-only addition with no code changes, following the same conventions
  established by JOKE.md in features 006 and 007: uppercase filename, H1 heading, concise content,
  valid GitHub-rendered markdown, UTF-8 encoding, and trailing newline.

# Open questions (must be resolved before implementation)
openQuestions:
  - question: "What filename should the design pattern markdown file use?"
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: "DESIGN_PATTERN.md"
        description: "Uppercase convention matching README.md and JOKE.md at repo root. Clearly and unambiguously describes the file's content. Consistent with the established project convention for standalone content files."
        selected: true
      - option: "design-pattern.md"
        description: "Lowercase with hyphen. More common in some ecosystems but breaks the uppercase convention already established by JOKE.md and README.md in this repo."
        selected: false
      - option: "PATTERNS.md"
        description: "Shorter, plural form. Suggests the file could grow into a collection, but this feature only adds one pattern and the plural name would be misleading at creation time."
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: "DESIGN_PATTERN.md follows the existing repo convention (uppercase for root-level content files like JOKE.md, README.md) and is self-descriptive. The lowercase variant breaks consistency, and PATTERNS.md implies multiple entries when only one is being added."
    answer: "DESIGN_PATTERN.md"

  - question: "Which design pattern should be described?"
    resolved: true
    options:
      - option: "Randomly chosen at implementation time"
        description: "The implementing agent picks any well-known GoF or architectural pattern (e.g., Singleton, Observer, Strategy, Factory, Decorator). Matches the feature name ('random') and keeps implementation simple without requiring user interaction."
        selected: true
      - option: "User specifies the pattern"
        description: "Pause implementation to ask the user which pattern to document. Adds a round-trip that delays a trivially small task; the feature name explicitly says 'random', so this contradicts stated intent."
        selected: false
    selectionRationale: "The feature is explicitly named 'random-design-pattern-desc'. Requiring user input contradicts the feature intent and adds unnecessary friction for a content-only S-sized task. The implementing agent should simply pick a well-known, clearly explainable pattern."
    answer: "Randomly chosen at implementation time"

# Markdown content (the actual spec)

  ## Problem Statement

  The repository currently contains a `JOKE.md` file added via features 006 and 007. Feature 008
  follows the same pattern: add a new markdown file (`DESIGN_PATTERN.md`) to the repository root
  containing a short, informative description of a randomly selected software design pattern.
  No code changes are required — this is a pure content addition.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] A file named `DESIGN_PATTERN.md` exists at the repository root
  - [ ] The file contains an H1 heading matching or describing the chosen design pattern name
  - [ ] The file includes at least: pattern name, category/type, intent/purpose, and a brief example or use case
  - [ ] The file renders correctly as valid Markdown on GitHub (no broken syntax)
  - [ ] The file is encoded as UTF-8
  - [ ] The file ends with a trailing newline
  - [ ] No existing files are modified
  - [ ] The described pattern is a recognized software design pattern (GoF, POSA, or widely accepted architectural pattern)

  ## Functional Requirements

  - **FR-1**: A new file `DESIGN_PATTERN.md` MUST be created at the repository root (`/`).
  - **FR-2**: The file MUST describe exactly one software design pattern, chosen at implementation time.
  - **FR-3**: The file MUST include an H1 heading (`#`) containing the pattern name.
  - **FR-4**: The content MUST cover: (a) pattern name and category, (b) the problem it solves / intent, (c) a brief description of the solution structure, and (d) a short example or real-world use case.
  - **FR-5**: The chosen pattern MUST be a well-known, named pattern from GoF (Gang of Four), POSA, or broadly recognized software architecture literature.
  - **FR-6**: No existing files in the repository SHALL be modified.

  ## Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR-1**: The file MUST be valid GitHub Flavored Markdown — renders without errors in GitHub's markdown renderer.
  - **NFR-2**: The file MUST be encoded in UTF-8 with a Unix-style trailing newline (`\n`).
  - **NFR-3**: Content MUST be concise — the description should be readable in under 2 minutes (roughly 150–400 words).
  - **NFR-4**: The writing style MUST be informative and neutral (not conversational/humorous), appropriate for a technical reference file.
  - **NFR-5**: The filename MUST use the uppercase convention consistent with other root-level content files (`JOKE.md`, `README.md`).

  ## Product Questions & AI Recommendations

  | # | Question | AI Recommendation | Rationale |
  | - | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
  | 1 | What filename should the design pattern markdown file use? | DESIGN_PATTERN.md | Matches uppercase convention of existing root-level content files (JOKE.md, README.md); self-descriptive and unambiguous |
  | 2 | Which design pattern should be described? | Randomly chosen at implementation time | Feature is explicitly named "random"; requiring user input contradicts intent and adds friction for a trivially small task |

  ## Codebase Analysis

  ### Project Structure

  ```
  /                        ← repo root (target location for DESIGN_PATTERN.md)
  ├── DESIGN_PATTERN.md    ← NEW FILE (this feature)
  ├── JOKE.md              ← precedent: standalone markdown content file
  ├── README.md            ← main project documentation
  ├── specs/               ← feature specifications
  │   ├── 006-joke-markdown/
  │   ├── 007-joke-markdown-2/
  │   └── 008-random-design-pattern-desc/

  └── tests/               ← test suite (not touched by this feature)
  ```

  ### Architecture Patterns

  The project is a Python CrewAI-based agentic platform. For this feature, architecture is
  irrelevant — we are adding a standalone markdown content file only. The established precedent
  from JOKE.md applies: uppercase filename, H1 heading, concise content, valid markdown,
  UTF-8 encoding, trailing newline.

  ### Relevant Technologies

  - **Markdown** — the only technology involved; must render correctly on GitHub

  ## Affected Areas

  | Area | Impact | Reasoning |
  | ---- | ------ | --------- |
  | Repository root | Low | Adding one new `.md` file; no existing files modified |

  ## Dependencies

  None. This feature has no code dependencies, no library requirements, and no integration points.

  ## Size Estimate

  **S** — Single new markdown file, content-only, no code, no tests. Identical in scope to
  features 006 and 007 (JOKE.md additions). Requirements analysis confirmed no scope expansion.
